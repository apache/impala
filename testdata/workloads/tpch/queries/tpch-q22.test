---- QUERY : TPCH-Q22_QUERY_1
# Q22 - Global Sales Opportunity Query
# Modifications: Added a cust_name_char column that will always have
# a constant value ('C') so that we can do a join between this table
# in the main query. This was needed because we only support equi-joins
# and had to have a column to join on.
