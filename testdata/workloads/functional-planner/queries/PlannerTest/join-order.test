# Test that filtering with "<=>" sets selectivity, just as "=" does. First, the
# base case: functional.alltypes.timestamp_col has more distinct vals than
# functional.alltypes.date_string_col. As a result, in a left semi join between
# functional.alltypes and itself, if one side of the join is filtered on timestamp_col and
# the other on date_string_col, the one filtered on timestamp_col is expected by the
# planner to be smaller and becomes the build side of the hash join.
