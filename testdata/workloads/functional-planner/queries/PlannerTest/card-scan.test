# Predicate tests
# In this file, "inequality" means not equals. It is a general
# term for <, <=, >, >=. The term "not equals" is used for the
# != (AKA <>) operator.
# tpch.customer.c_custkey is a unique column with value range
# [1..150000].
#
# No predicate at all. Establishes cardinality baseline.
