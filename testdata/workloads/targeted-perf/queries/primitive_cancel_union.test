---- QUERY: primitive_cancel_union
-- Description : Union with a cheap branch and expensive branch
-- Target test case : Regression test for IMPALA-6984. The query
--  benefits from the coordinator immediately cancelling the expensive branch
--  of the union when the limit has been reached. With that optimization the
--  query typically completes in under a second.
