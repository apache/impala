---- QUERY
# IMPALA-5485: exchange nodes can hit out-of-memory. This query was tuned so that
# it hits the memory limit in the exchange node when allocating receiver-side
# buffers. It's also possible but less likely that this will hit a memory limit
# in the scan nodes.
# IMPALA-9355: An exchange node does not set a memory limit for buffer pool. To
# hit the memory limit exceeding error reliably, the memory limit for the entire query
# has to be set to a value less than 171520k (167.5Mb) which is the minimum for the query
# to be accepted after the result spooling is enabled by default. Disable result spooling
# here by setting spool_query_results to false, and set the query memory limit to 164Mb.
