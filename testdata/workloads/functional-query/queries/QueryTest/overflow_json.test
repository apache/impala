---- QUERY
# Tests overflow of numeric in JSON. In JSON, numeric can be stored as either number or
# string types. Due to limitations in RapidJSON, numeric values that overflow will result
# in a parsing error (kParseErrorNumberTooBig), even when using the
# kParseNumbersAsStringsFlag. This parsing error is difficult to recover from, so we can
# only fill it with NULL and report the error. However, for numbers stored as strings,
# there is no such limitation, and they can be passed to the TextConverter for further
# processing.
