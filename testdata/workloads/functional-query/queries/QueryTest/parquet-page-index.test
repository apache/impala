# These tests check that the page selection and value-skipping logic works well when using
# the page index of the Parquet file. 'decimals_1_10' contains tiny, misaligned pages and
# some NULL values. Column 'd_10' has one value per page, while column 'd_1' has five
# values per page. Thus, with putting predicates on column 'd_10' we can craft different
# test cases for value skipping in 'd_1'.

# 'd_10 = 1' selects the first row from each page. Therefore in the pages of 'd_1' we
