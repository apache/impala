---- QUERY
# Testing scanning of multi-line JSON, rapidjson can handle cases where line breaks appear
# in JSON (except for those that appear in numbers and strings), so in most cases it can
# scan multi-line JSON. However, line breaks in strings and numbers are treated as invalid
# values, and the scanner returns null. Additionally, it should be noted that if the line
# break in the multi-line JSON is near the beginning of the scan range, it may cause the
# parser to misjudge the starting position of the first complete JSON (because it always
# starts parsing from the position after the first line break). This usually has no
# effect (except report a error), but if there happens to be a sub-object immediately
# after the line break, itwill cause an extra line of data to be scanned. If the line
# break in the multi-line JSONis also at the beginning of the scan range, it will cause
# the last line of data from the previous scan range to be incomplete.
