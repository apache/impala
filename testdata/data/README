Contains 3 single-column rows:
"parquet"
"is"
"fun"

bad_compressed_dict_page_size.parquet:
Generated by hacking Impala's Parquet writer.
Contains a single string column 'col' with one row ("a"). The compressed_page_size field
in dict page header is modifed to 0 to test if it is correctly handled.

bad_rle_literal_count.parquet:
Generated by hacking Impala's Parquet writer.
Contains a single bigint column 'c' with the values 1, 3, 7 stored
in a single data chunk as dictionary plain. The RLE encoded dictionary
indexes are all literals (and not repeated), but the literal count
is incorrectly 0 in the file to test that such data corruption is
proprly handled.

bad_rle_repeat_count.parquet:
Generated by hacking Impala's Parquet writer.
Contains a single bigint column 'c' with the value 7 repeated 7 times
stored in a single data chunk as dictionary plain. The RLE encoded dictionary
indexes are a single repeated run (and not literals), but the repeat count
is incorrectly 0 in the file to test that such data corruption is proprly
handled.

      {"name": "int_array", "type": ["null", {"type": "array", "items": ["null", "int"]}]}
  ]
 }
Contains 3 row groups, each with ten rows and each array containing ten elements. The
first rowgroup column metadata for 'int_array' incorrectly states there are 50 values

out_of_range_timestamp.parquet:
Generated with a hacked version of Impala parquet writer.
Contains a single timestamp column with 4 values, 2 of which are out of range
and should be read as NULL by Impala:
   1399-12-31 00:00:00 (invalid - date too small)

repeated_root_schema.parquet:
Generated by hacking Impala's Parquet writer.
Created to reproduce IMPALA-4826. Contains a table of 300 rows where the
repetition level of the root schema is set to REPEATED.
Reproduction steps:

   file_metadata_.schema[0].__set_repetition_type(FieldRepetitionType::REQUIRED);
2: Run test_compute_stats and grab the created Parquet file for
   alltypes_parquet table.

binary_decimal_dictionary.parquet,
binary_decimal_no_dictionary.parquet:
Generated using parquet-mr and contents verified using parquet-tools-1.9.1.
Contains decimals stored as variable sized BYTE_ARRAY with both dictionary
and non-dictionary encoding respectively.

alltypes_agg_bitpacked_def_levels.parquet:
Generated by hacking Impala's Parquet writer to write out bitpacked def levels instead
of the standard RLE-encoded levels. See
https://github.com/timarmstrong/incubator-impala/tree/hack-bit-packed-levels. This
is a single file containing all of the alltypesagg data, which includes a mix of
null and non-null values. This is not actually a valid Parquet file because the
bit-packed levels are written in the reverse order specified in the Parquet spec
for BIT_PACKED. However, this is the order that Impala attempts to read the levels
in - see IMPALA-3006.

signed_integer_logical_types.parquet:
Generated using a utility that uses the java Parquet API.
The file has the following schema:
  schema {
    optional int32 id;
    optional int32 tinyint_col (INT_8);
    optional int32 smallint_col (INT_16);
    optional int32 int_col;
    optional int64 bigint_col;
  }

min_max_is_nan.parquet:
Generated by Impala's Parquet writer before the fix for IMPALA-6527. Git hash: 3a049a53
Created to test the read path for a Parquet file with invalid metadata, namely when
'max_value' and 'min_value' are both NaN. Contains 2 single-column rows:
NaN
42

bad_codec.parquet:
Generated by Impala's Parquet writer, hacked to use the invalid enum value 5000 for the
compression codec. The data in the file is the whole of the "alltypestiny" data set, with
the same columns: id int, bool_col boolean, tinyint_col tinyint, smallint_col smallint,
int_col int, bigint_col bigint, float_col float, double_col double,
date_string_col string, string_col string, timestamp_col timestamp, year int, month int

num_values_def_levels_mismatch.parquet:
A file with a single boolean column with page metadata reporting 2 values but only def
levels for a single literal value. Generated by hacking Impala's parquet writer to
increment page.header.data_page_header.num_values. This caused Impala to hit a DCHECK
(IMPALA-6589).

rle_encoded_bool.parquet:
Parquet v1 file with RLE encoded boolean column "b" and int column "i".
Created for IMPALA-6324, generated with modified parquet-mr. Contains 279 rows,
139 with value false, and 140 with value true. "i" is always 1 if "b" is True
and always 0 if "b" is false.

dict_encoding_with_large_bit_width.parquet:
Parquet file with a single TINYINT column "i" with 33 rows. Created by a modified
Impala to use 9 bit dictionary indices for encoding. Reading this file used to lead
to DCHECK errors (IMPALA-7147).

decimal_stored_as_int32.parquet:
Parquet file generated by Spark 2.3.1 that contains decimals stored as int32.
Impala needs to be able to read such values (IMPALA-5542)

decimal_stored_as_int64.parquet:
Parquet file generated by Spark 2.3.1 that contains decimals stored as int64.
Impala needs to be able to read such values (IMPALA-5542)

decimal_padded_fixed_len_byte_array.parquet:
Parquet file generated by a hacked Impala where decimals are encoded as
FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY with an extra byte of padding (IMPALA-2515). The
data is the same as functional.decimal_tbl.

decimal_padded_fixed_len_byte_array2.parquet:
Parquet file generated by a hacked Impala where decimals are encoded as
FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY with an extra byte of padding (IMPALA-2515).
The Impala was hacked to limit dictionaries to 2000 entries, and
PARQUET_PAGE_ROW_COUNT_LIMIT was set to 1234. The resulted in
a file with two dictionary encoded pages and multiple plain
encoded pages. The values are distributed across the full
range of DECIMAL(10, 0). The file was created as follows:

  create table d(d decimal(10, 0)) stored as parquet;
  set num_nodes=1;
  set PARQUET_PAGE_ROW_COUNT_LIMIT=1234;
  insert into d
  select distinct cast((1000000000 - (o_orderkey * 110503)) % 1000000000 as decimal(9, 0))
  from tpch_parquet.orders where o_orderkey < 50000;


primitive_type_widening.parquet:
Parquet file that contains two rows with the following schema:
- int32 tinyint_col1
- int32 tinyint_col2
- int32 tinyint_col3
- int32 tinyint_col4
- int32 smallint_col1
- int32 smallint_col2
- int32 smallint_col3
- int32 int_col1
- int32 int_col2
- float float_col
It is used to test primitive type widening (IMPALA-6373).

corrupt_footer_len_decr.parquet:
Parquet file that contains one row of the following schema:
- bigint c
The footer size is manually modified (using hexedit) to be the original file size minus
1, to cause metadata deserialization in footer parsing to fail, thus trigger the printing
of an error message with incorrect file offset, to verify that it's fixed by IMPALA-6442.

corrupt_footer_len_incr.parquet:
Parquet file that contains one row of the following schema:
- bigint c
The footer size is manually modified (using hexedit) to be larger than the original file
size and cause footer parsing to fail. It's used to test an error message related to
IMPALA-6442.

hive_single_value_timestamp.parq:
Parquet file written by Hive with the followin schema:
i int, timestamp d
Contains a single row. It is used to test IMPALA-7559 which only occurs when all values
in a column chunk are the same timestamp and the file is written with parquet-mr (which
is used by Hive).

out_of_range_time_of_day.parquet:
IMPALA-7595: Parquet file that contains timestamps where the time part is out of the
valid range [0..24H). Before the fix, select * returned these values:
1970-01-01 -00:00:00.000000001  (invalid - negative time of day)
1970-01-01 00:00:00
1970-01-01 23:59:59.999999999
1970-01-01 24:00:00 (invalid - time of day should be less than a whole day)

strings_with_quotes.csv:
Various strings with quotes in them to reproduce bugs like IMPALA-7586.

int64_timestamps_plain.parq:
Parquet file generated with Parquet-mr that contains plain encoded int64 columns with
Timestamp logical types. Has the following columns:
new_logical_milli_utc, new_logical_milli_local,
new_logical_micro_utc, new_logical_micro_local

int64_timestamps_dict.parq:
Parquet file generated with Parquet-mr that contains dictionary encoded int64 columns
with Timestamp logical types. Has the following columns:
id,
new_logical_milli_utc, new_logical_milli_local,
new_logical_micro_utc, new_logical_micro_local

int64_timestamps_at_dst_changes.parquet:
Parquet file generated with Parquet-mr that contains plain encoded int64 columns with
Timestamp logical types. The file contains 3 row groups, and all row groups contain
3 distinct values, so there is a "min", a "max", and a "middle" value. The values were
selected in such a way that the UTC->CET conversion changes the order of the values (this
is possible during Summer->Winter DST change) and "middle" falls outside the "min".."max"
range after conversion. This means that a naive stat filtering implementation could drop
"middle" incorrectly.
Example (all dates are 2017-10-29):
UTC: 00:45:00, 01:00:00, 01:10:00 =>
CET: 02:45:00, 02:00:00, 02:10:00
Columns: rawvalue bigint, rowgroup int, millisutc timsestamp, microsutc timestamp

int64_timestamps_nano.parquet:
Parquet file generated with Parquet-mr that contains int64 columns with nanosecond
precision. Tested separately from the micro/millisecond columns because of the different
valid range.
Columns: rawvalue bigint, nanoutc timestamp, nanononutc timestamp

out_of_range_timestamp_hive_211.parquet:
Hive-generated file with an out-of-range timestamp. Generated with Hive 2.1.1 using
the following query:
create table alltypes_hive stored as parquet as
select * from functional.alltypes
union all
select -1, false, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', cast('1399-01-01 00:00:00' as timestamp), 0, 0

out_of_range_timestamp2_hive_211.parquet:
Hive-generated file with out-of-range timestamps every second value, to exercise code
paths in Parquet scanner for non-repeated runs. Generated with Hive 2.1.1 using
the following query:
create table hive_invalid_timestamps stored as parquet as
select id,
  case id % 3
    when 0 then timestamp_col
    when 1 then NULL
    when 2 then cast('1300-01-01 9:9:9' as timestamp)
  end timestamp_col
from functional.alltypes
sort by id

decimal_rtf_tbl.txt:
This was generated using formulas in Google Sheets.  The goal was to create various
decimal values that covers the 3 storage formats with various precision and scale.
This is a reasonably large table that is used for testing min-max filters
with decimal types on Kudu.

decimal_rtf_tiny_tbl.txt:
Small table with specific decimal values picked from decimal_rtf_tbl.txt so that
min-max filter based pruning can be tested with decimal types on Kudu.

date_tbl.orc
Small orc table with one DATE column, created by Hive.

date_tbl.avro
Small avro table with one DATE column, created by Hive.

date_tbl.parquet
Small parquet table with one DATE column, created by Parquet MR.

out_of_range_date.parquet:
Generated with a hacked version of Impala parquet writer.
Contains a single DATE column with 9 values, 4 of which are out of range
and should be read as NULL by Impala:
  -0001-12-31 (invalid - date too small)
   0000-01-01 (invalid - date too small)
   0000-01-02 (invalid - date too small)
   1969-12-31
   1970-01-01
   1970-01-02
   9999-12-30
   9999-12-31
  10000-01-01 (invalid - date too large)

out_of_range_date.orc:
Created using a pre-3.1. Hive version (2.1.1.) to contain an out-of-range date value.
Took advantage of the incompatibility between Hive and Impala when Hive (before 3.1)
writes a date before 1582-10-15 is interpreted incorrectly by Impala. The values I wrote
with Hive:
2019-10-04, 1582-10-15, 0001-01-01, 9999-12-31
This is interpreted by Impala as:
2019-10-04, 1582-10-15, 0000-12-30 (invalid - date too small), 9999-12-31



hive2_pre_gregorian.parquet:
Small parquet table with one DATE column, created by Hive 2.1.1.
Used to demonstrate parquet interoperability issues between Hive and Impala for dates
before the introduction of Gregorian calendar in 1582-10-15.

hive2_pre_gregorian.orc:
Same as the above but in ORC format instead of Parquet.

decimals_1_10.parquet:
Contains two decimal columns, one with precision 1, the other with precision 10.
I used Hive 2.1.1 with a modified version of Parquet-MR (6901a20) to create tiny,
misaligned pages in order to test the value-skipping logic in the Parquet column readers.
The modification in Parquet-MR was to set MIN_SLAB_SIZE to 1. You can find the change
here: https://github.com/boroknagyz/parquet-mr/tree/tiny_pages
hive  --hiveconf parquet.page.row.count.limit=5 --hiveconf parquet.page.size=5

                            (1, 1), (NULL, 2), (3, 3), (NULL, 4), (5, 5),
                            (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (NULL, 4), (NULL, 5),
                            (NULL, 1), (2, 2), (NULL, 3), (NULL, 4), (5, 5),
                            (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, NULL);

nested_decimals.parquet:

iceberg:
IMPALA-9741: Support querying Iceberg table by impala
We generated data by spark-shell, version is 2.4.x, and there are two tables' data in
testdata/data/iceberg_test. Iceberg table location contains
two directories: metadata, which contains table metadata managed
by iceberg; data, which contains the data files.

iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/complextypestbl_iceberg_orc:
Iceberg table generated by Hive 3.1 + Iceberg 0.11. Originally it was a HiveCatalog
table, so I've renamed the metadata JSON files and added a version-hint.text file.
I've also edited the metadata JSON and AVRO files to remove 'hdfs://localhost:20500',
and updated the file paths. Now it can be used as a HadoopCatalog table.

hudi_parquet:
IMPALA-8778: Support read Apache Hudi tables
Hudi parquet is a special format of parquet files managed by Apache Hudi
(hudi.incubator.apache.org) to provide ACID transaction.
In order to provide snapshot isolation between writer and queries,
Hudi will write a newer version of the existing parquet file
if there is any update comes into the file.
Hudi store the indexing information and version information in the file name.
For example:
`ca51fa17-681b-4497-85b7-4f68e7a63ee7-0_1-5-10_20200112194517.parquet`
`ca51fa17-681b-4497-85b7-4f68e7a63ee7-0` is the bloom index hash of this file
`20200112194517` is the timestamp of this version
If there is a record was updated in this file, Hudi will write a new file with
the same indexing hash but a newer version depends on the time of writing.
`ca51fa17-681b-4497-85b7-4f68e7a63ee7-0_1-38-282_20200112194529.parquet`
If the impala table was refreshed after this file was written, impala will
only query on the file with latest version.

streaming.orc:
ORC file generated by Hive Streaming Ingestion. I used a slightly altered version of
TestStreaming.testNoBuckets() from Hive 3.1 to generate this file. It contains
values coming from two transactions. The file has two stripes (one per transaction).

alltypes_non_acid.orc:
Non-acid ORC file generated by Hive 3.1 with the following command:
CREATE TABLE alltypes_clone STORED AS ORC AS SELECT * FROM functional.alltypes.
It's used as an original file in ACID tests.

dateless_timestamps.parq:
Parquet file generated before the removal of dateless timestamp support.
Created as: CREATE TABLE timestamps_pq(t TIMESTAMP) STORED AS parquet;
It contains the folloving lines:
1996-04-22 10:00:00.432100000
1996-04-22 10:00:00.432100000
1996-04-22 10:00:00
1996-04-22 10:00:00

doesn't have the file user metadata 'hive.acid.version'.

alltypes_empty_pages.parquet
Parquet file that contians empty data pages. Needed to test IMPALA-9952.
Generated by a modified Impala (git hash e038db44 (between 3.4 and 4.0)). I modified
HdfsParquetTableWriter::ShouldStartNewPage() to randomly start a new page:
int64_t r = random(); if (r % 2 + r % 3 + r % 5 == 0) return true;
Also modified HdfsParquetTableWriter::NewPage() to randomly insert empty pages:
if (r ... ) pages_.push_back(DataPage());

alltypes_invalid_pages.parquet
Parquet file that contains invalid data pages Needed to test IMPALA-9952.
Generated by a modified Impala (git hash e038db44 (between 3.4 and 4.0)). I modified
HdfsParquetTableWriter::ShouldStartNewPage() to randomly start a new page:
int64_t r = random(); if (r % 2 + r % 3 + r % 5 == 0) return true;
Also modified HdfsParquetTableWriter::BaseColumnWriter::Flush to randomly invalidate
the offset index:
if (r ... ) location.offset = -1;

customer_multiblock_page_index.parquet
Parquet file that contains multiple blocks in a single file Needed to test IMPALA-10310.
In order to generate this file, execute the following instruments:
// use 1.11.0 to generate page index
1. export HIVE_AUX_JARS_PATH=/path/parquet-hadoop-1.11.0.jar
// in hive shell
2. SET parquet.block.size=8192;         // use little block size
3. SET parquet.page.row.count.limit=10; // little page row count generate multi pages
4. CREATE TABLE customer_multiblock_page_index_6
   STORED AS PARQUET
   TBLPROPERTIES('parquet.compression'='SNAPPY')
   AS SELECT * FROM tpcds.customer
   WHERE c_current_cdemo_sk IS NOT NULL ORDER BY c_current_cdemo_sk LIMIT 2000;
generated file will contains multi blocks, multi pages per block.

customer_nested_multiblock_multipage.parquet
Parquet file that contains multiple row groups multiple pages and store nested
data.
Used Hive (version 3.1.3000.7.2.16.0-233) to generate Parquet file:

2. SET parquet.page.row.count.limit=20;
3. CREATE TABLE customer_nested_multiblock_multipage
   LIKE tpch_nested_parquet.customer STORED AS PARQUET;
4. INSERT INTO customer_nested_multiblock_multipage
   SELECT * FROM tpch_nested_parquet.customer ORDER BY c_custkey LIMIT 300;

IMPALA-10361: Use field id to resolve columns for Iceberg tables
We generated data by spark-shell, version is 2.4.x, and table data is in

(65b95fb72be8f5a8a193a6f7bc4560fdcd742fc7).
The schema was completely changed to allow us to test types supported in Parquet Bloom
filters.

ComplexTypesTbl/arrays.orc and arrays.parq
These tables hold 3 columns, an int ID and two arrays, one with int and the second with
string. The purpose of introducing these tables is to give more test coverage for zipping
unnests. There are rows where the 2 arrays are of the same lenght, or one of them is
longer than the other plus there are NULL and empty arrays as well.

binary_decimal_precision_and_scale_widening.parquet
Parquet file written with schema (decimal(9,2), decimal(18,2), decimal(38,2)). The rows
inside the file are carefully chosen so that they don't cause an overflow when being read
by an Impala table with a higher precision/scale.

iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/airports_parquet:
Regular Parquet table converted to Iceberg, which means that the data file doesn't contain
field ids.

iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/airports_orc:
Regular ORC table converted to Iceberg, which means that the data file doesn't contain
field ids.

too_many_def_levels.parquet:
Written by Impala 2.5. The Parquet pages have more encoded def levels than num_values.

partition_col_in_parquet.parquet:
Written by Impala 4.0. Parquet file with INT and DATE column. Values in the DATE columns
are identical. There's only a single value per page in the Parquet file (written by
setting query option 'parquet_page_row_count_limit' to 1).

no_scale.parquet
Generated by code injection, removed scale from written parquet files:
Status HdfsParquetTableWriter::WriteFileFooter() {
+  file_metadata_.schema[1].__set_scale(1);
+  file_metadata_.schema[1].__isset.scale = false;
+  file_metadata_.schema[1].logicalType.DECIMAL.scale = 1;
+  file_metadata_.schema[1].logicalType.__isset.DECIMAL = false;
+  file_metadata_.schema[1].__isset.logicalType = false;
create table my_decimal_tbl (d1 decimal(4,2)) stored as parquet;
insert into my_decimal_tbl values (cast(0 as decimal(4,2)));

iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/alltypes_part:
iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/alltypes_part_orc:
Generated by Hive 3.1 + Iceberg 0.11. Then the JSON and AVRO files were manually edited
to make these tables correspond to an Iceberg table in a HadoopCatalog instead of
HiveCatalog.
alltypes_part has PARQUET data files, alltypes_part_orc has ORC data files. They have
identity partitions with all the supported data types.

iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/iceberg_legacy_partition_schema_evolution:
iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/iceberg_legacy_partition_schema_evolution_orc:
Generated by Hive 3.1 + Iceberg 0.11. Then the JSON and AVRO files were manually edited
to make these tables correspond to an Iceberg table in a HadoopCatalog instead of
HiveCatalog.
iceberg_legacy_partition_schema_evolution has PARQUET data files,
iceberg_legacy_partition_schema_evolution_orc has ORC data files.
The tables that have the following schema changes since table migration:
* Partition INT column to BIGINT
* Partition FLOAT column to DOUBLE
* Partition DECIMAL(5,3) column to DECIMAL(8,3)
* Non-partition column has been moved to end of the schema

iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/iceberg_timestamp_part:
Written by Hive, contains Iceberg TIMESTAMP type and the table is partitioned by HOUR(ts).
create table iceberg_timestamp_part (i int, ts timestamp) partitioned by spec (hour(ts))  stored by iceberg;
insert into iceberg_timestamp_part values (-2, '1969-01-01 01:00:00'), (-1, '1969-01-01 01:15:00'), (1, '2021-10-31 02:15:00'), (2, '2021-01-10 12:00:00'), (3, '2022-04-11 00:04:00'), (4, '2022-04-11 12:04:55');

iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/iceberg_timestamptz_part:
Written by Hive, contains Iceberg TIMESTAMPTZ type and the table is partitioned by
HOUR(ts). The local timezone was 'Europe/Budapest';
create table iceberg_timestamptz_part (i int, ts timestamp with local time zone) partitioned by spec (hour(ts))  stored by iceberg;
insert into iceberg_timestamptz_part values (-2, '1969-01-01 01:00:00'), (-1, '1969-01-01 01:15:00'), (0, '2021-10-31 00:15:00 UTC'), (1, '2021-10-31 01:15:00 UTC'), (2, '2021-01-10 12:00:00'), (3, '2022-04-11 00:04:00'), (4, '2022-04-11 12:04:55');

iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/iceberg_uppercase_col:
Generated by Impala, then modified the metadata.json file to contain uppercase characters.

iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/iceberg_v2_delete_positional:
Generated by Spark 3.2 + Iceberg 0.13. Then the JSON and AVRO files were manually edited
to make these tables correspond to an Iceberg table in a HadoopCatalog instead of
HiveCatalog.
The table has a positional delete file.

iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/iceberg_v2_delete_equality:
Since Hive/Spark is unable to write equality delete files Flink has been used to create
an equality delete file by overwriting an existing unique row with the following
statements:
    CREATE TABLE `ssb`.`ssb_default`.`iceberg_v2_delete_equality` (
      `id`  BIGINT UNIQUE COMMENT 'unique id',
      `data` STRING NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(`id`) NOT ENFORCED
    ) with ('format-version'='2',
    'write.upsert.enabled'='true',
    'connector' = 'iceberg',
    'catalog-database' = 'test_db',
    'catalog-type' = 'hive',
    'catalog-name' = 'iceberg_hive_catalog',
    'hive-conf-dir' = '/etc/hive/conf',
    'engine.hive.enabled' = 'true'
    );
    insert into iceberg_v2_delete_equality values (1, 'test_1_base');
    insert into iceberg_v2_delete_equality values (2, 'test_2_base');
    insert into iceberg_v2_delete_equality values (2, 'test_2_updated');
This table was created with HDFS absolute paths, which were replaced with the script
specified in `iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/iceberg_v2_no_deletes`.

iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/iceberg_v2_delete_equality_nulls:
This table has an equality delete file that contains NULL value. Created by a hacked
Impala where IcebergCatalogOpExecutor is changed to write equality delete metadata
instead of position delete metadata when running a DELETE FROM statement. In a second
step the underlying delete file was replaced by another parquet file with the desired
content.
The content:
1: insert into functional_parquet.iceberg_v2_delete_equality_nulls values (1, "str1"), (null, "str2"), (3, "str3");
2: EQ-delete file for the first column with values: (null), (3)
3: insert into functional_parquet.iceberg_v2_delete_equality_nulls values (4, "str4"), (null, "str5");
As a result 2 values (including the row with null) will be dropped from the first data
file, while there is going to be another data file containing a null value that has
greater data sequence number than the delete file.

iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/iceberg_v2_delete_both_eq_and_pos:
This table is created by Flink with 2 columns as primary key. Some data and equality
delete files were added by Flink, and then Impala was used for dropping a row by writing
a positional delete file.
Steps:
1-Flink:
  create table ice.iceberg_v2_delete_both_eq_and_pos
    (i int, s string, d date, primary key (i, d) not enforced)
    with ('format-version'='2', 'write.upsert.enabled'='true');
2: Flink:
  insert into ice.iceberg_v2_delete_both_eq_and_pos values
    (1, 'str1', to_date('2023-12-13')),
    (2, 'str2', to_date('2023-12-13'));
3-Flink:
  insert into ice.iceberg_v2_delete_both_eq_and_pos values
    (3, 'str3', to_date('2023-12-23')),
    (2, 'str2_updated', to_date('2023-12-13'));
4-Impala: delete from functional_parquet.iceberg_v2_delete_both_eq_and_pos where i = 1;

iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/iceberg_v2_delete_equality_partitioned:
Flink is used for creating this test table. The statements executed are the follow:
1: Create the table with the partition column part of the primary key. This is enforced
by Flink:
  create table ice.iceberg_v2_delete_equality_partitioned
    (i int, s string, d date, primary key (d, s) not enforced)
    partitioned by (d)
  with ('format-version'='2', 'write.upsert.enabled'='true');
2: Populate one partition.
  insert into ice.iceberg_v2_delete_equality_partitioned partition (d='2023-12-24') values
    (1, 'str1'), (2, 'str2'), (3, 'str3');
3: Populate another partition
  insert into ice.iceberg_v2_delete_equality_partitioned partition (d='2023-12-25') values
    (1, 'str1'), (2, 'str2');
4: Update one row in the first partiton and add a new row.
  insert into ice.iceberg_v2_delete_equality_partitioned partition (d='2023-12-24') values
    (333333, 'str3'), (4, 'str4');
5: Update one row in the second partition.
  insert into ice.iceberg_v2_delete_equality_partitioned partition (d='2023-12-25') values
    (222, 'str2');

iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/iceberg_v2_delete_equality_partition_evolution:
Flink is used to create and populate this simple table to have an equlity delete file.
Impala is used for doing some partition evolution on this table.
1-Flink:
  create table ice.iceberg_v2_delete_equality_partition_evolution
    (i int, s string, d date, primary key (d, s) not enforced)
    partitioned by (d)
    with ('format-version'='2', 'write.upsert.enabled'='true');
2-Flink:
  insert into ice.iceberg_v2_delete_equality_partition_evolution
    partition (d='2023-12-24') values (1, 'str1'), (2, 'str2');
3-Flink:
  insert into ice.iceberg_v2_delete_equality_partition_evolution
    partition (d='2023-12-24') values (111, 'str1');
4-Impala:
  alter table functional_parquet.iceberg_v2_delete_equality_partition_evolution
    set partition spec (d, i);

iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/iceberg_v2_delete_equality_multi_eq_ids:
Used Impala and Nifi to create a table that has equality delete files with different
equality field ID lists. Steps:
1-Impala:
  create table functional_parquet.iceberg_v2_delete_equality_multi_eq_ids
      (i int not null, s string not null, primary key(i))
      STORED AS ICEBERG
      TBLPROPERTIES('iceberg.catalog'='hadoop.catalog',

              'iceberg.table_identifier'='ice.iceberg_v2_delete_equality_multi_eq_ids',
              'format-version'='2');
2-Nifi: Insert 3 rows in one data file:
  (1, "str1"), (2, "str2"), (3, "str3")
3-Nifi: Update a row using column 'i' as PK:
  (3, "str3_updated")
4: Manually edited 'identifier-field-ids' from [1] to [2]
5-Nifi: In One step insert new rows and update existing ones using column 's' as PK:
  Insert (4, "str4"), (5, "str5")
  Update (2222, "str2"), (3333, "str3_updated")
6: Manually edited 'identifier-field-ids' from [2] to [1,2]
7: Update rows using columns [i,s] as PK:
  (4, "str4") -> (4, "str4_updated"), (3333, "str3_updated") -> (33, "str3_updated_twice")

iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/iceberg_v2_delete_pos_and_multi_eq_ids:
Used Flink and Impala to create a table that has both positional and equality delete
files where some of the equality deletes have different equality field IDs.
1-Flink:
  create table hadoop_catalog.ice.iceberg_v2_delete_pos_and_multi_eq_ids
      (i int not null, s string not null, d date not null, primary key(i,s) not enforced)
      with ('format-version'='2', 'write.upsert.enabled'='true');
2-Flink:
  insert into hadoop_catalog.ice.iceberg_v2_delete_pos_and_multi_eq_ids values
      (1, 'str1', to_date('2024-01-23')),
      (2, 'str2', to_date('2024-01-24')),
      (3, 'str3', to_date('2024-01-25'));
3-Flink:

      (1, 'str1', to_date('2020-12-01')),
      (4, 'str4', to_date('2024-01-26'));
4-Impala:
  delete from functional_parquet.iceberg_v2_delete_pos_and_multi_eq_ids where s = 'str2';
5: Manually edited 'identifier-field-ids' from [1,2] to [3,2].
6: Restarted Flink to forget the table metadata.
7-Flink:
  insert into hadoop_catalog.ice.iceberg_v2_delete_pos_and_multi_eq_ids values
      (333333, 'str3', to_date('2024-01-25')),

iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/iceberg_v2_no_deletes:
Created by Hive 3.1.3000.2022.0.10.0-49 r5cd8759d0df2ecbfb788b7f4ee0edce6022ee459
create table iceberg_v2_no_deletes (i int, s string)
stored by iceberg
location '/test-warehouse/iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/iceberg_v2_no_deletes'
tblproperties ('format-version'='2');
insert into iceberg_v2_no_deletes values (1, 'x'), (2, 'y'), (3, 'z');
(setting table location is important because it makes it easier the conversion later).
Then saved the contents from HDFS to local  ${IMPALA_HOME}/testdata/data/iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice
And converted the HiveCatalog metadata to HadoopCatalog metadata via the following scripts:
convert_to_iceberg.sh:
#!/bin/bash

i=0
for f in *.json; do
  i=$((i+1))
  sed -i 's|hdfs://localhost:20500/test-warehouse/|/test-warehouse/|' $f
  mv $f v${i}.metadata.json
done
echo ${i} > version-hint.txt

for f in *.avro; do
  avro_iceberg_convert.sh $f 'hdfs://localhost:20500/test-warehouse/'  '/test-warehouse/'
  mv ${f}_mod $f
done

rm *.avro_json

avro_iceberg_convert.sh:
#!/bin/bash

# Usage: avro_iceberg_convert.sh <source avro> <search string> <replace string>
# Example:
SOURCE_FILE=$1
SEARCH_STR=$2
REPLACE_STR=$3
TMP_JSON=$1_json
DST_AVRO=$1_mod
AVRO_TOOLS="/path/to/avro-tools-1.11.0.jar"

if [ ! -f "$AVRO_TOOLS" ]; then
    echo "Can't find $AVRO_TOOLS."
    exit
fi
if [ ! -f $SOURCE_FILE ]; then
    echo "Can't find source file: $SOURCE_FILE!"
    exit
fi
# Transform avro to json:
java -jar $AVRO_TOOLS tojson --pretty $SOURCE_FILE  > $TMP_JSON
# Replace search string with replace string
sed --in-place "s|$SEARCH_STR|$REPLACE_STR|g" $TMP_JSON
# Convert the file back to avro
SCHEMA=`java -jar $AVRO_TOOLS getschema $SOURCE_FILE`
java -jar $AVRO_TOOLS fromjson $TMP_JSON --schema "$SCHEMA" > $DST_AVRO

These updates the manifest files and their length probably change. Snapshot files store the
length of the manifest files, so it need to be changed as well. If it only stores one manifest:

avro_iceberg_convert.sh FILE "\"manifest_length.*$" "\"manifest_length\" : SIZE,"
mv FILE_mod FILE

If a snapshot has multiple manifest files, then you need to change manually the previously generated
*_json files and transform it back using avro tools, the last step of avro_iceberg_convert.sh, or
use testdata/bin/rewrite-iceberg-metadata.py

iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice/iceberg_with_key_metadata:
Created by the following steps:
 - saved the HDFS directory of 'iceberg_v2_no_deletes' to local
   ${IMPALA_HOME}/testdata/data/iceberg_test/hadoop_catalog/ice
 - converted the avro manifest file to json
 - manually replaced the 'null' value for "key_metadata" with "{"bytes" :
   "binary_key_metadata"}"
 - converted the modified json file back to avro.
 - adjusted the length of manifest file in the avro snapshot file

The commands for converting the avro file to json and back are listed under
'iceberg_v2_no_deletes' in the script avro_iceberg_convert.sh. Adjusting the length is
described after the script.

iceberg_v2_null_delete_record:
1) Created the table via Impala and added some records to it.
  CREATE TABLE iceberg_v2_null_delete_record(i INT, j INT)
  STORED BY ICEBERG;
  INSERT INTO iceberg_v2_null_delete_record VALUES (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4);
  INSERT INTO iceberg_v2_null_delete_record VALUES (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4);

  (We need at least 2 data files to use DIRECTED mode in KrpcDataStreamSender)

2) Created the following temporary table:
  CREATE TABLE iceberg_v2_null_delete_record_pos_delete (file_path STRING, pos BIGINT)
  STORED BY ICEBERG;

  Manually rewrote the metadata JSON file of this table, so the schema elements have the
  following field ids (there are two places where I had to modify the schemas):

    file_path : 2147483546
    pos       : 2147483545

3) Inserted data files into iceberg_v2_null_delete_record_pos_delete:

  INSERT INTO iceberg_v2_null_delete_record_pos_delete VALUES
  (NULL, 0);

  INSERT INTO iceberg_v2_null_delete_record_pos_delete VALUES
  ('<data file path of iceberg_v2_null_delete_record>', 0), (NULL, 3);

  INSERT INTO iceberg_v2_null_delete_record_pos_delete VALUES
  (NULL, 2), ('<data file path of iceberg_v2_null_delete_record>', 0);

  INSERT INTO iceberg_v2_null_delete_record_pos_delete VALUES
  (NULL, 0), (NULL, 1), (NULL, 2);

  The written Parquet files have the schema of position delete files (with the
  correct Iceberg field ids)

4) Copied iceberg_v2_null_delete_record to the local filesystem and applied
  the following modifications:

  * added the Parquet files from iceberg_v2_null_delete_record_pos_delete to
    the /data directory
  * manually edited the metadata JSON, and the manifest and manifest list files to
    register the delete files in the table
