"fun"

bad_rle_literal_count.parquet:
Generated by hacking Impala's Parquet writer.
Contains a single bigint column 'c' with the values 1, 3, 7 stored
in a single data chunk as dictionary plain. The RLE encoded dictionary
indexes are all literals (and not repeated), but the literal count
is incorrectly 0 in the file to test that such data corruption is
proprly handled.

bad_rle_repeat_count.parquet:
Generated by hacking Impala's Parquet writer.
Contains a single bigint column 'c' with the value 7 repeated 7 times
stored in a single data chunk as dictionary plain. The RLE encoded dictionary
indexes are a single repeated run (and not literals), but the repeat count
is incorrectly 0 in the file to test that such data corruption is proprly
handled.

Generated by hacking Impala's Parquet writer.
The file metadata indicates zero rows and no row groups.

zero_rows_one_row_group.parquet:
Generated by hacking Impala's Parquet writer.
The file metadata indicates zero rows but one row group.

huge_num_rows.parquet

bad_column_metadata.parquet:

Schema:
 {"type": "record",
  "namespace": "org.apache.impala",
  "name": "bad_column_metadata",
  "fields": [

      {"name": "int_array", "type": ["null", {"type": "array", "items": ["null", "int"]}]}
  ]
 }
Contains 3 row groups, each with ten rows and each array containing ten elements. The
first rowgroup column metadata for 'int_array' incorrectly states there are 50 values
(instead of 100), and the second rowgroup column metadata for 'id' incorrectly states
there are 11 values (instead of 10). The third rowgroup has the correct metadata.
