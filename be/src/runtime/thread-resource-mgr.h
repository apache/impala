/// Singleton object to manage CPU (aka thread) resources for the process.
/// Conceptually, there is a fixed pool of threads that are shared between
/// query fragments.  If there is only one fragment running, it can use the
/// entire pool, spinning up the maximum number of threads to saturate the
/// hardware.  If there are multiple fragments, the CPU pool must be shared
/// between them.  Currently, the total system pool is split evenly between
/// all consumers.  Each consumer gets ceil(total_system_threads / num_consumers).
//
/// Each fragment must register with the ThreadResourceMgr to request threads
/// (in the form of tokens).  The fragment has required threads (it can't run
/// with fewer threads) and optional threads.  If the fragment is running on its
/// own, it will be able to spin up more optional threads.  When the system
/// is under load, the ThreadResourceMgr will stop giving out tokens for optional
/// threads.
/// Pools should not use this for threads that are almost always idle (e.g.
/// periodic reporting threads).
/// Pools will temporarily go over the quota regularly and this is very
/// much by design.  For example, if a pool is running on its own with
/// 4 required threads and 28 optional and another pool is added to the
/// system, the first pool's quota is then cut by half (16 total) and will
/// over time drop the optional threads.
/// This class is thread safe.
/// TODO: this is an initial simple version to improve the behavior with
/// concurrency.  This will need to be expanded post GA.  These include:
///  - More places where threads are optional (e.g. hash table build side,
///    data stream threads, etc).
///  - Admission control
///  - Integration with other nodes/statestore
///  - Priorities for different pools
/// If both the mgr and pool locks need to be taken, the mgr lock must
/// be taken first.
