/// A RowBatch encapsulates a batch of rows, each composed of a number of tuples.
/// The maximum number of rows is fixed at the time of construction.
/// The row batch reference a few different sources of memory.
///   1. TupleRow ptrs - may be malloc'd and owned by the RowBatch or allocated from
///      the tuple pool, depending on whether legacy joins and aggs are enabled.
///      See the comment on tuple_ptrs_ for more details.
///   2. Tuple memory - this is allocated (or transferred to) the row batches tuple pool.
///   3. Auxiliary tuple memory (e.g. string data) - this can either be stored externally
///      (don't copy strings) or from the tuple pool (strings are copied).  If external,
///      the data is in an io buffer that may not be attached to this row batch.  The
///      creator of that row batch has to make sure that the io buffer is not recycled
///      until all batches that reference the memory have been consumed.
/// In order to minimize memory allocations, RowBatches and TRowBatches that have been
/// serialized and sent over the wire should be reused (this prevents compression_scratch_
/// from being needlessly reallocated).
//
/// Row batches and memory usage: We attempt to stream row batches through the plan
/// tree without copying the data. This means that row batches are often not-compact
/// and reference memory outside of the row batch. This results in most row batches
/// having a very small memory footprint and in some row batches having a very large
/// one (it contains all the memory that other row batches are referencing). An example
/// is IoBuffers which are only attached to one row batch. Only when the row batch reaches
/// a blocking operator or the root of the fragment is the row batch memory freed.
/// This means that in some cases (e.g. very selective queries), we still need to
/// pass the row batch through the exec nodes (even if they have no rows) to trigger
/// memory deletion. AtCapacity() encapsulates the check that we are not accumulating
/// excessive memory.
//
/// A row batch is considered at capacity if all the rows are full or it has accumulated
/// auxiliary memory up to a soft cap. (See at_capacity_mem_usage_ comment).
