///
/// The coordinator monitors the execution status of fragment instances and aborts the

/// 3. client: GetNext()*/client: Cancel()/backend: UpdateBackendExecStatus()

/// A query is considered to be executing until one of three things occurs:
/// 1. An error is encountered. Backend cancellation is automatically initiated for all

/// 2. The query is cancelled via an explicit Cancel() call. The overall query status
///    is set to CANCELLED and cancellation is initiated for all backends still
///    executing (without an error status).
/// 3. The query has returned all rows. The overall query status is OK (and remains
///    OK). Client cancellation is no longer possible and subsequent backend errors are
///    ignored. The coordinator initiates cancellation for all backends and waits for the
