/// The QueryDriver owns the ClientRequestStates for a query. A single query can map
/// to multiple ClientRequestStates if the query is retried multiple times. The
/// QueryDriver sits between the ImpalaServer and ClientRequestState. Currently, it
/// mainly handles query retries.
///
/// ImpalaServer vs. QueryDriver vs. ClientRequestState vs. Coordinator:
///
/// All of these classes work together to run a client-submitted query end to end. A
/// client submits a request to the ImpalaServer to run a query. The ImpalaServer
/// creates a QueryDriver and ClientRequestState to run the query. The
/// ClientRequestState creates a Coordinator that is responsible for coordinating the
/// execution of all query fragments and for tracking the lifecyle of the fragments. A
/// fetch results request flows from the ImpalaServer to the ClientRequestState and then
/// to the Coordinator, which fetches the results from the fragment running on the
/// coordinator process.
///
/// Query Retries:
///
/// Query retries are driven by the 'TryQueryRetry' and 'RetryQueryFromThread' methods.
/// Each query retry creates a new ClientRequestState. In other words, a single
/// ClientRequestState corresponds to a single attempt of a query. Thus, a QueryDriver can
/// own multiple ClientRequestStates, one for each query attempt.
///
/// Retries are done asynchronously in a separate thread. If the query cannot be retried
/// for any reason, the original query is unregistered and moved to the ERROR state. The
/// steps required to launch a retry of a query are very similar to the steps necessary
/// to start the original attempt of the query, except parsing, planning, optimizing,
/// etc. are all skipped. This is done by cacheing the TExecRequest from the original
/// query and re-using it for all query retries.
///
/// At a high level, retrying a query requires performing the following steps:
///   * Cancelling the original query
///   * Creating a new ClientRequestState with a unique query id and a copy of the
///     TExecRequest from the original query
///   * Registering the new query (ImpalaServer::RegisterQuery)
///   * Launching the new query (ClientRequestState::Exec)
///   * Closing and unregistering the original query
///
/// *Transparent* Query Retries:
/// A key feature of query retries is that they should be "transparent" from the client
/// perspective. No client code modifications should be necessary to support query
/// retries. The QueryDriver makes query retries "transparent" by introducing the
/// concept of an "active" ClientRequestState. The "active" ClientRequestState refers
/// to the currently running attempt to run the query, and is accessible by the method
/// GetActiveClientRequestState(). Callers (e.g. ImpalaServer) can use this method to get
/// a reference to the most recent attempt of the query.
///
/// Disclaimer: While query retries are designed to be *transparent* there are scenarios
/// where clients may see some unexpected behavior when a query is retried.
///
/// When a query is retried, the retry is modeled as a brand new query with a new query
/// id, which will be distinct from the query id of the originally submitted query that
/// ultimately failed. So users might see multiple query ids in play during the lifecycle
/// of a single query submission.
///
/// Since a query retry is a brand new query, that query has its own runtime profile as
/// well; the runtime profiles of the failed and retried queries will be linked together.
/// Users need to be aware that there can be multiple runtime profiles associated with a
/// single query submission.
///
/// Thread Safety:
///
/// Only GetClientRequestState(query_id) and GetActiveClientRequestState() are thread
/// safe. They are protected by an internal SpinLock.
