/// TmpFileMgr provides an abstraction for management of temporary (a.k.a. scratch) files
/// on the filesystem and I/O to and from them. TmpFileMgr manages multiple scratch
/// directories across multiple devices, configured via the --scratch_dirs option.
/// TmpFileMgr manages I/O to scratch files in order to abstract away details of which
/// files are allocated and recovery from certain I/O errors. I/O is done via DiskIoMgr.
/// TmpFileMgr encrypts data written to disk if enabled by the --disk_spill_encryption
/// command-line flag.
///
/// FileGroups manage scratch space across multiple devices. To write to scratch space,
/// first a FileGroup is created, then FileGroup::Write() is called to asynchronously
/// write a memory buffer to one of the scratch files. FileGroup::Write() returns a
/// WriteHandle, which is used by the caller to identify that write operation. The
/// caller is notified when the asynchronous write completes via a callback, after which
/// the caller can use the WriteHandle to read back the data.
///
/// Each WriteHandle is backed by a range of data in a scratch file. The first call to
/// Write() will create files for the FileGroup with unique filenames on the configured
/// temporary devices. At most one directory per device is used (unless overridden for
/// testing). The file range of a WriteHandle can be replaced with a different one if
/// a write error is encountered and the data instead needs to be written to a different
/// disk.
///
/// Free Space Management:
/// Free space is managed within a FileGroup: once a WriteHandle is destroyed, the file
/// range backing it can be recycled for a different WriteHandle. Scratch file ranges
/// are grouped into size classes, each for a power-of-two number of bytes. Free file
/// ranges of each size class are managed separately (i.e. there is no splitting or
/// coalescing of ranges).
///
/// Resource Management:
/// TmpFileMgr provides some basic support for managing local disk space consumption.
/// A FileGroup can be created with a limit on the total number of bytes allocated across
/// all files. Writes that would exceed the limit fail with an error status.
///
/// TODO: IMPALA-4683: we could implement smarter handling of failures, e.g. to
/// temporarily blacklist devices that show I/O errors.
