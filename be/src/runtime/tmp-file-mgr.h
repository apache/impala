/// TmpFileMgr provides an abstraction for management of temporary (a.k.a. scratch) files
/// on the filesystem and I/O to and from them. TmpFileMgr manages multiple scratch
/// directories across multiple devices, configured via the --scratch_dirs option.
/// TmpFileMgr manages I/O to scratch files in order to abstract away details of which
/// files are allocated and recovery from certain I/O errors. I/O is done via DiskIoMgr.
/// TmpFileMgr encrypts data written to disk if enabled by the --disk_spill_encryption
/// command-line flag.
///
/// TmpFileGroups manage scratch space across multiple devices. To write to scratch space,
/// first a TmpFileGroup is created, then TmpFileGroup::Write() is called to
/// asynchronously write a memory buffer to one of the scratch files.
/// TmpFileGroup::Write() returns a TmpWriteHandle, which identifies that write operation.
/// The caller is notified when the asynchronous write completes via a callback, after
/// which the caller can use the TmpWriteHandle to read back the data.
///
/// Each TmpWriteHandle is backed by a range of data in a scratch file. The first call to
/// Write() will create files for the TmpFileGroup with unique filenames on the configured
/// temporary devices. At most one directory per device is used (unless overridden for
/// testing). The file range of a TmpWriteHandle can be replaced with a different one if
/// a write error is encountered and the data instead needs to be written to a different
/// disk.
///
/// Free Space Management:
/// Free space is managed within a TmpFileGroup: once a TmpWriteHandle is destroyed, the
/// file range backing it can be recycled for a different TmpWriteHandle. Scratch file
/// ranges are grouped into size classes, each for a power-of-two number of bytes. Free
/// file ranges of each size class are managed separately (i.e. there is no splitting or
/// coalescing of ranges).
///
/// Resource Management:
/// TmpFileMgr provides some basic support for managing local disk space consumption.
/// A TmpFileGroup can be created with a limit on the total number of bytes allocated
/// across all files. Writes that would exceed the limit fail with an error status.
/// The TmpFileBufferPool provides the ability for write ranges to wait for local
/// buffer space in a separate thread during spilling to remote file system, the purpose
/// of the pool is to handle the competitions for buffer files allocation with limited
/// local space.
///
/// Locking:
/// During spilling, multiple locks could be acquired, to avoid deadlocks, the order
/// of acquiring must be from lower-numbered locks to higher-numbered locks:
/// 1. BufferPool::Client::lock_
/// 2. BufferPool::Page::buffer_lock
/// 3. TmpFileGroup::lock_
/// 4. TmpFileBufferPool::lock_
/// 5. TmpWriteHandle::write_state_lock_
/// 6. RequestContext::lock_
/// 7. ScanRange::lock_
/// 8. DiskFile::physical_file_lock_
/// Specially, it may need to acquire both locks of two types of DiskFile during spilling
/// to remote filesystem, the order to acquire DiskFile's locks must be from local
/// DiskFile to remote DiskFile.
///
/// Ohter than the locks above, terminal locks, meaning no other locks should be acquired
/// while holding this one, could be used during spilling:
/// TmpFileBufferPool::tmp_files_avail_pool_lock_
/// TmpFileGroup::tmp_files_remote_ptrs_lock_
