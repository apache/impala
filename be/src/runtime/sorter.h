/// Sorter contains the external sort implementation. Its purpose is to sort arbitrarily
/// large input data sets with a fixed memory budget by spilling data to disk if
/// necessary.
//
/// The client API for Sorter is as follows:
/// AddBatch() is used to add input rows to be sorted. Multiple tuples in an input row are
/// materialized into a row with a single tuple (the sort tuple) using the materialization
/// exprs in sort_tuple_exprs_. The sort tuples are sorted according to the sort
/// parameters and output by the sorter. AddBatch() can be called multiple times.
//
/// Callers that don't want to spill can use AddBatchNoSpill() instead, which only adds
/// rows up to the memory limit and then returns the number of rows that were added.
/// For this use case, 'enable_spill' should be set to false so that the sorter can reduce
/// the number of buffers requested from the block mgr since there won't be merges.
//
/// InputDone() is called to indicate the end of input. If multiple sorted runs were
/// created, it triggers intermediate merge steps (if necessary) and creates the final
/// merger that returns results via GetNext().
//
/// GetNext() is used to retrieve sorted rows. It can be called multiple times.
/// AddBatch()/AddBatchNoSpill(), InputDone() and GetNext() must be called in that order.
//
/// Batches of input rows are collected into a sequence of pinned BufferPool pages
/// called a run. The maximum size of a run is determined by the number of pages that
/// can be pinned by the Sorter. After the run is full, it is sorted in memory, unpinned
/// and the next run is constructed. The variable-length column data (e.g. string slots)
/// in the materialized sort tuples are stored in a separate sequence of pages from the
/// tuples themselves.  When the pages containing tuples in a run are unpinned, the
/// var-len slot pointers are converted to offsets from the start of the first var-len
/// data page. When a page is read back, these offsets are converted back to pointers.
/// The in-memory sorter sorts the fixed-length tuples in-place. The output rows have the
/// same schema as the materialized sort tuples.
//
/// After the input is consumed, the sorter is left with one or more sorted runs. If
/// there are multiple runs, the runs are merged using SortedRunMerger. At least one
/// page per run (two if there are var-length slots) must be pinned in memory during
/// a merge, so multiple merges may be necessary if the number of runs is too large.
/// First a series of intermediate merges are performed, until the number of runs is
/// small enough to do a single final merge that returns batches of sorted rows to the
/// caller of GetNext().
///
/// If there is a single sorted run (i.e. no merge required), only tuple rows are
/// copied into the output batch supplied by GetNext(), and the data itself is left in
/// pinned pages held by the sorter.
///
/// When merges are performed, one input batch is created to hold tuple rows for each
/// input run, and one batch is created to hold deep copied rows (i.e. ptrs + data) from
/// the output of the merge.
//
/// Note that Init() must be called right after the constructor.
//
/// During a merge, one row batch is created for each input run, and one batch is created
/// for the output of the merge (if is not the final merge). It is assumed that the memory
/// for these batches have already been accounted for in the memory budget for the sort.
/// That is, the memory for these batches does not come out of the buffer pool.
//
/// TODO: Not necessary to actually copy var-len data - instead take ownership of the
/// var-length data in the input batch. Copying can be deferred until a run is unpinned.
/// TODO: When the first run is constructed, create a sequence of pointers to materialized
/// tuples. If the input fits in memory, the pointers can be sorted instead of sorting the
/// tuples in place.
