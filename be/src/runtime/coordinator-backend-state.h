///     release all PENDING backends. This is particularly useful when combined with
///     result spooling because the Coordinator backend may be long lived. When result
///     spooling is enabled, and clients don't immediately fetch query results, the
///     coordinator fragment stays alive until the results are fetched or the query is
///     closed.
///     * Timed Release: If more than 'FLAGS_release_backend_states_delay_ms' milliseconds
///     have elapsed since the last time a Backend completed, release all PENDING
///     backends. This is useful for queries that are long running, and whose Backends
///     complete incrementally (perhaps because of skew or fan-in). It also helps decrease
///     the rate at which Backends are released, especially for short lived queries.
///     * Batched Release: If more than half the remaining Backends have been released
///     since the last time Backends were released, release all PENDING backends. This
///     bounds the number of times resources are released to O(log(n)) where n is the
///     number of backends. The base value of the logarithm is controlled by
