The following SSL certificates are used in Impala tests. This lists what each certificate is
responsible for and how they were created:

  1) wildcardCA.pem & wildcardCA.key:

    This is a root certificate and its key which was used to sign wildcard-cert.pem and
    wildcard-san-cert.pem. (Added as a part of IMPALA-3159). The common name is "*"

    This was created using the following commands:

      openssl genrsa -out wildcardCA.key 2048

      openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key wildcardCA.key -sha256 -days 10000 \
          -out wildcardCA.pem
        (Fill in all the details according to prompts)

-------------
  2) wildcard-cert.pem & wildcard-cert.key:

    This is a wildcard certificate and its corresponding key which has its commonName as
    "*.impala.test".  (Added as a part of IMPALA-3159, updated related to IMPALA-13790)

    This was created using the following commands:

      openssl genrsa -out wildcard-cert.key 2048

      openssl req -new -key wildcard-cert.key -out wildcard-cert.csr \
          -subj "/C=US/ST=CA/L=SF/O=Cloudera/CN=*.impala.test"

      openssl x509 -req -in wildcard-cert.csr -CA wildcardCA.pem -CAkey wildcardCA.key \
          -CAcreateserial -out wildcard-cert.pem -days 10000 -sha256

-------------
  3) wildcard-san-cert.pem & wildcard-san-cert.key:

    This is a certificate and its corresponding key which has 2 SANs
    (subjectAlternativeName). One is "alsoBad" and the other is a wildcard
    ("*.impala.test").
    (Added as a part of IMPALA-3159, updated related to IMPALA-13790)

    This was created using the following commands:

      openssl genrsa -out wildcard-san-cert.key 2048

      openssl req -new -sha256 -key wildcard-san-cert.key \
          -subj "/C=US/ST=CA/L=SF/O=Cloudera/CN=badCN" -reqexts SAN \
          -config <(cat /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf <(printf "[SAN]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:alsoBad,DNS:*.impala.test")) \
          -out wildcard-san-cert.csr

      openssl x509 -req -in wildcard-san-cert.csr -CA wildcardCA.pem \
          -CAkey wildcardCA.key -CAcreateserial \
          -extfile <(cat /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf <(printf "[SAN]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:alsoBad,DNS:*.impala.test")) \
          -extensions SAN -out wildcard-san-cert.pem -days 10000 -sha256

-------------
  4) server-key.pem & server-key-password.pem & server-cert.key:

    This is a self-signed certificate and its corresponding key which has the commonName
    as "localhost" and subject alternative name "DNS:localhost,IP:192.168.1.1". It also
    specifies CA:FALSE to be clear that this is a leaf certificate.

    This was created using the following commands:

      openssl genrsa -out server-key.pem 2048

      openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key server-key.pem -sha256 -days 10000 -out server-cert.pem \
          -addext 'basicConstraints=CA:FALSE' \
          -addext 'subjectAltName=DNS:localhost,IP:192.168.1.1'

      (Fill in all the details according to prompts with common name set to 'localhost')

      openssl rsa -aes256 -in server-key.pem -out server-key-password.pem

      (Specify "password" for the pass phrase)

-------------
  5) incorrect-commonname-cert.pem & incorrect-commonname-cert.key:

    This is a certificate and its corresponding key that has an incorrect commonName,
    which means that it should not match with any host. (Added as a part of IMPALA-3159)

      This was created the same as 1) with a different commonName.

-------------
To verify the contents of any certificate, do the following:

  openssl x509 -in <certificate_name> -text
