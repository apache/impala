/// Linear or quadratic probing hash table implementation tailored to the usage pattern
/// for partitioned hash aggregation and hash joins. The hash table stores TupleRows and
/// allows for different exprs for insertions and finds. This is the pattern we use for
/// joins and aggregation where the input/build tuple row descriptor is different from the
/// find/probe descriptor. The implementation is designed to allow codegen for some paths.
//
/// In addition to the hash table there is also an accompanying hash table context that is
/// used for insertions and probes. For example, the hash table context stores evaluated
/// expr results for the current row being processed when possible into a contiguous
/// memory buffer. This allows for efficient hash computation.
//
/// The hash table does not support removes. The table is optimized for the partition hash
/// aggregation and hash joins and is not intended to be a generic hash table
/// implementation.
///
/// Operations that mutate the hash table are not thread-safe. Read-only access to the
/// hash table, is, however, thread safe: multiple threads, each with their own
/// HashTableCtx, can safely look up rows in the hash table with FindProbeRow(), etc so
/// long as no thread is mutating the hash table. Thread-safe methods are explicitly
/// documented.
///
/// The data (rows) are stored in a BufferedTupleStream. The basic data structure of this
/// hash table is a vector of buckets. The buckets (indexed by the mod of the hash)
/// contain a pointer to either the slot in the tuple-stream or in case of duplicate
/// values, to the head of a linked list of nodes that in turn contain a pointer to
/// tuple-stream slots. When inserting an entry we start at the bucket at position
/// (hash % size) and search for either a bucket with the same hash or for an empty
/// bucket. If a bucket with the same hash is found, we then compare for row equality and
/// either insert a duplicate node if the equality is true, or continue the search if the
/// row equality is false. Similarly, when probing we start from the bucket at position
/// (hash % size) and search for an entry with the same hash or for an empty bucket.
/// In the former case, we then check for row equality and continue the search if the row
/// equality is false. In the latter case, the probe is not successful. When growing the
/// hash table, the number of buckets is doubled. We trigger a resize when the fill
/// factor is approx 75%. Due to the doubling nature of the buckets, we require that the
/// number of buckets is a power of 2. This allows us to perform a modulo of the hash
/// using a bitmask.
///
/// We choose to use linear or quadratic probing because they exhibit good (predictable)
/// cache behavior.
///
/// The first NUM_SMALL_BLOCKS of nodes_ are made of blocks less than the IO size (of 8MB)
/// to reduce the memory footprint of small queries.
///
/// TODO: Compare linear and quadratic probing and remove the loser.
/// TODO: We currently use 32-bit hashes. There is room in the bucket structure for at
/// least 48-bits. We should exploit this space.
/// TODO: Consider capping the probes with a threshold value. If an insert reaches
/// that threshold it is inserted to another linked list of overflow entries.
/// TODO: Smarter resizes, and perhaps avoid using powers of 2 as the hash table size.
/// TODO: this is not a fancy hash table in terms of memory access patterns
/// (cuckoo-hashing or something that spills to disk). We will likely want to invest
/// more time into this.
/// TODO: hash-join and aggregation have very different access patterns.  Joins insert all
/// the rows and then calls scan to find them.  Aggregation interleaves FindProbeRow() and
/// Inserts().  We may want to optimize joins more heavily for Inserts() (in particular
