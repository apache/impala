/// scope saves IO as the filters are applied before scan ranges are issued.
/// 2. Per-scan-range (all file formats, partition column filters only) - filtering at
/// this scope saves CPU as filtered scan ranges are never scanned.

///
///   TotalRawHdfsReadTime - the total wall clock time spent by Disk I/O threads in HDFS
///     read operations. For example, if we have 3 reading threads and each spent 1 sec,
///     this counter will report 3 sec.
///
///   TotalRawHdfsOpenFileTime - the total wall clock time spent by Disk I/O threads in
///     HDFS open operations.
///
///   PerReadThreadRawHdfsThroughput - the read throughput in bytes/sec for each HDFS
///     read thread while it is executing I/O operations on behalf of this scan.
///
///   NumDisksAccessed - number of distinct disks accessed by HDFS scan. Each local disk
///     is counted as a disk and each remote disk queue (e.g. HDFS remote reads, S3)
///     is counted as a distinct disk.
///
///   ScannerIoWaitTime - total amount of time scanner threads spent waiting for
///     I/O. This is comparable to ScannerThreadsTotalWallClockTime in the traditional
///     HDFS scan nodes and the scan node total time for the MT_DOP > 1 scan nodes.
///     Low values show that each I/O completed before or around the time that the
///     scanner thread was ready to process the data. High values show that scanner
///     threads are spending significant time waiting for I/O instead of processing data.
///     Note that if CPU load is high, this can include time that the thread is runnable
///     but not scheduled.
///
///   AverageHdfsReadThreadConcurrency - the average number of HDFS read threads
///     executing read operations on behalf of this scan. Higher values show that this
///     scan is using a larger proportion of the I/O capacity of the system. Lower values
///     show that either this thread is not I/O bound or that it is getting a small share
///     of the I/O capacity of the system because of other concurrently executing
