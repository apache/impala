///     read thread while it is executing I/O operations on behalf of this scan.

///     is counted as a disk and each remote disk queue (e.g. HDFS remote reads, S3)
///     is counted as a distinct disk.
///
///   ScannerIoWaitTime - total amount of time scanner threads spent waiting for
///     I/O. This is comparable to ScannerThreadsTotalWallClockTime in the traditional
///     HDFS scan nodes and the scan node total time for the MT_DOP > 1 scan nodes.
///     Low values show that each I/O completed before or around the time that the
///     scanner thread was ready to process the data. High values show that scanner
///     threads are spending significant time waiting for I/O instead of processing data.
///     Note that if CPU load is high, this can include time that the thread is runnable
///     but not scheduled.
///
///   AverageHdfsReadThreadConcurrency - the average number of HDFS read threads
///     executing read operations on behalf of this scan. Higher values show that this
///     scan is using a larger proportion of the I/O capacity of the system. Lower values
