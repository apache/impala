/// Abstract base class of all scan nodes. Subclasses support different storage layers
/// and different threading models.
///
/// Includes ScanNode common counters:
///   BytesRead - total bytes read from disk by this scan node. Provided as a counter
///     as well as a time series that samples the counter. Only implemented for scan node
///     subclasses that expose the bytes read, e.g. HDFS and HBase.
///
///   TotalReadThroughput - BytesRead divided by the total wall clock time that this scan
///     was executing (from Open() to Close()). This gives the aggregate rate that data
///     is read from disks. If this is the only scan executing, ideally this will
///     approach the maximum bandwidth supported by the disks.
///
///   RowsRead - number of top-level rows/tuples read from the storage layer, including
///     those discarded by predicate evaluation. Used for all types of scans.
///
///   CollectionItemsRead - total number of nested collection items read by the scan.
///     Only created for scans (e.g. Parquet) that support nested types.
///
///   ScanRangesComplete - number of scan ranges completed. Initialized for scans that
///     have a concept of "scan range".
///
///   MaterializeTupleTime - wall clock time spent materializing tuples and evaluating
///     predicates.
///
/// The following counters are specific to multithreaded scan node implementations:
///
///   PeakScannerThreadConcurrency - the peak number of scanner threads executing at any
///     one time. Present only for multithreaded scan nodes.
///
///   AverageScannerThreadConcurrency - the average number of scanner threads executing
///     between Open() and the time when the scan completes. Present only for
///     multithreaded scan nodes.
///
///   NumScannerThreadsStarted - the number of scanner threads started for the duration
///     of the ScanNode. This is at most the number of scan ranges but should be much
///     less since a single scanner thread will likely process multiple scan ranges.
///     This is *not* the same as peak scanner thread concurrency because the number of
///     scanner threads can fluctuate during execution of the scan.
///
///   ScannerThreadsTotalWallClockTime - total wall clock time spent in all scanner
///     threads.
///
///   ScannerThreadsUserTime, ScannerThreadsSysTime,
///   ScannerThreadsVoluntaryContextSwitches, ScannerThreadsInvoluntaryContextSwitches -
///     these are aggregated counters across all scanner threads of this scan node. They
///     are taken from getrusage. See RuntimeProfile::ThreadCounters for details.
///
///   RowBatchesEnqueued, RowBatchBytesEnqueued - Number of row batches and bytes enqueued
///     in the scan node's output queue.
///
///   RowBatchQueueGetWaitTime - Wall clock time that the fragment execution thread spent
///     blocked waiting for row batches to be added to the scan node's output queue.
///
///   RowBatchQueuePutWaitTime - Wall clock time that the scanner threads spent blocked
///     waiting for space in the scan node's output queue when it is full.
///
///   RowBatchQueueCapacity - capacity in batches of the scan node's output queue.
///
///   RowBatchQueuePeakMemoryUsage - peak memory consumption of row batches enqueued in
///     the scan node's output queue.
