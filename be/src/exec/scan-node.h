/// Abstract base class of all scan nodes; introduces SetScanRange().
//
/// Includes ScanNode common counters:
///   BytesRead - total bytes read by this scan node. Provided as a counter as well
///     as a time series that samples the counter.
//
///   TotalRawReadTime - it measures the total time spent in underlying reads.
///     For HDFS files, this is the time in the disk-io-mgr's reading threads for
///     this node. For example, if we have 3 reading threads and each spent
///     1 sec, this counter will report 3 sec.
///     For HBase, this is the time spent in the region server.
//
///   TotalReadThroughput - BytesRead divided by the total time spent in this node
///     (from Open to Close). For IO bounded queries, this should be very close to the
///     total throughput of all the disks.
//
///   PerDiskRawHdfsThroughput - the read throughput for each disk. If all the data reside
///     on disk, this should be the read throughput the disk, regardless of whether the
///     query is IO bounded or not.
//
///   NumDisksAccessed - number of disks accessed.
//
///   AverageScannerThreadConcurrency - the average number of active scanner threads. A
///     scanner thread is considered active if it is not blocked by IO. This number would
///     be low (less than 1) for IO-bound queries. For cpu-bound queries, this number
///     would be close to the max scanner threads allowed.
//
///   AverageHdfsReadThreadConcurrency - the average number of active hdfs reading threads
///     reading for this scan node. For IO bound queries, this should be close to the
///     number of disk.
//
///   Hdfs Read Thread Concurrency Bucket - the bucket counting (%) of hdfs read thread
///     concurrency.
//
///   NumScannerThreadsStarted - the number of scanner threads started for the duration
///     of the ScanNode. This is at most the number of scan ranges but should be much
///     less since a single scanner thread will likely process multiple scan ranges.
//
///   ScanRangesComplete - number of scan ranges completed
//
///   MaterializeTupleTime - time spent in creating in-memory tuple format
//
///   ScannerThreadsTotalWallClockTime - total time spent in all scanner threads.
//
///   ScannerThreadsUserTime, ScannerThreadsSysTime,
///   ScannerThreadsVoluntaryContextSwitches, ScannerThreadsInvoluntaryContextSwitches -
///     these are aggregated counters across all scanner threads of this scan node. They
///     are taken from getrusage. See RuntimeProfile::ThreadCounters for details.
