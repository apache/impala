/// scan range will be able to locate. Note that checking context_->eosr() after reading
/// each sync is insufficient for determining 'eos_'. If a sync marker spans two scan
/// ranges, the first scan range must process the following block since the second scan
/// range cannot find the incomplete sync. context_->eosr() will not alert us to this
