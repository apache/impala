/// Aggregator for doing grouping aggregations. Input is passed to the aggregator through
/// AddBatch(), or AddBatchStreaming() if this is a pre-agg. Then:
///  1. Each row is hashed and we pick a dst partition (hash_partitions_).
///  2. If the dst partition is not spilled, we probe into the partitions hash table
///  to aggregate/insert the row.
///  3. If the partition is already spilled, the input row is spilled.
///  4. When all the input is consumed, we walk hash_partitions_, put the spilled ones
///  into spilled_partitions_ and the non-spilled ones into aggregated_partitions_.
///  aggregated_partitions_ contain partitions that are fully processed and the result
///  can just be returned. Partitions in spilled_partitions_ need to be repartitioned
///  and we just repeat these steps.
//
/// Each partition contains these structures:
/// 1) Hash Table for aggregated rows. This contains just the hash table directory
///    structure but not the rows themselves. This is NULL for spilled partitions when
///    we stop maintaining the hash table.
/// 2) MemPool for var-len result data for rows in the hash table. If the aggregate
///    function returns a string, we cannot append it to the tuple stream as that
///    structure is immutable. Instead, when we need to spill, we sweep and copy the
///    rows into a tuple stream.
/// 3) Aggregated tuple stream for rows that are/were in the hash table. This stream
///    contains rows that are aggregated. When the partition is not spilled, this stream
///    is pinned and contains the memory referenced by the hash table.
///    In the case where the aggregate function does not return a string (meaning the
///    size of all the slots is known when the row is constructed), this stream contains
///    all the memory for the result rows and the MemPool (2) is not used.
/// 4) Unaggregated tuple stream. Stream to spill unaggregated rows.
///    Rows in this stream always have child(0)'s layout.
///
/// Buffering: Each stream and hash table needs to maintain at least one buffer when
/// it is being read or written. The streams for a given agg use a uniform buffer size,
/// except when processing rows larger than that buffer size. In that case, the agg uses
/// BufferedTupleStream's variable buffer size support to handle larger rows up to the
/// maximum row size. Only two max-sized buffers are needed for the agg to spill: one
/// to hold rows being read from a spilled input stream and another for a temporary write
/// buffer when adding a row to an output stream.
///
/// Two-phase aggregation: we support two-phase distributed aggregations, where
/// pre-aggregrations attempt to reduce the size of data before shuffling data across the
/// network to be merged by the merge aggregation node. This aggregator supports a
/// streaming mode for pre-aggregations where it maintains a hash table of aggregated
/// rows, but can pass through unaggregated rows (after transforming them into the
/// same tuple format as aggregated rows) when a heuristic determines that it is better
/// to send rows across the network instead of consuming additional memory and CPU
/// resources to expand its hash table. The planner decides whether a given
/// pre-aggregation should use the streaming preaggregation algorithm or the same
/// blocking aggregation algorithm as used in merge aggregations.
/// TODO: make this less of a heuristic by factoring in the cost of the exchange vs the
/// cost of the pre-aggregation.
///
/// Handling memory pressure: the node uses two different strategies for responding to
/// memory pressure, depending on whether it is a streaming pre-aggregation or not. If
/// the node is a streaming preaggregation, it stops growing its hash table further by
/// converting unaggregated rows into the aggregated tuple format and passing them
/// through. If the node is not a streaming pre-aggregation, it responds to memory
/// pressure by spilling partitions to disk.
///
/// TODO: Buffer rows before probing into the hash table?
/// TODO: After spilling, we can still maintain a very small hash table just to remove
/// some number of rows (from likely going to disk).
/// TODO: Consider allowing to spill the hash table structure in addition to the rows.
/// TODO: Do we want to insert a buffer before probing into the partition's hash table?
/// TODO: Use a prefetch/batched probe interface.
/// TODO: Return rows from the aggregated_row_stream rather than the HT.
/// TODO: Think about spilling heuristic.
/// TODO: When processing a spilled partition, we have a lot more information and can
/// size the partitions/hash tables better.
/// TODO: Start with unpartitioned (single partition) and switch to partitioning and
/// spilling only if the size gets large, say larger than the LLC.
/// TODO: Simplify or cleanup the various uses of agg_fn_ctx, agg_fn_ctx_, and ctx.
/// There are so many contexts in use that a plain "ctx" variable should never be used.
/// Likewise, it's easy to mixup the agg fn ctxs, there should be a way to simplify this.
