/// the split can occur anywhere in the file, e.g. in the middle of a row. Each scanner
/// starts materializing tuples right after the first row delimiter found in the scan
/// range, and stops at the first row delimiter occurring past the end of the scan
/// range. If no delimiter is found in the scan range, the scanner doesn't materialize
/// anything. This scheme ensures that every row is materialized by exactly one scanner.
///
/// A special case is a "\r\n" row delimiter split across two scan ranges. (When the row
/// delimiter is '\n', we also consider '\r' and "\r\n" row delimiters.) In this case, the
/// delimiter is considered part of the second scan range, i.e., the first scan range's
/// scanner is responsible for the tuple directly before it, and the second scan range's
/// scanner for the tuple directly after it.
