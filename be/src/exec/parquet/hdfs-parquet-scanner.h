/// This scanner parses Parquet files located in HDFS, and writes the content as tuples in
/// the Impala in-memory representation of data, e.g.  (tuples, rows, row batches).
/// For the file format spec, see: github.com/apache/parquet-format
///
/// ---- Schema resolution ----
/// Additional columns are allowed at the end in either the table or file schema (i.e.,
/// extra columns at the end of the schema or extra fields at the end of a struct).  If
/// there are extra columns in the file schema, they are simply ignored. If there are
/// extra in the table schema, we return NULLs for those columns (if they're
/// materialized).
///
/// ---- Disk IO ----
/// Parquet (and other columnar formats) use scan ranges differently than other formats.
/// Each materialized column maps to a single ScanRange per row group.  For streaming
/// reads, all the columns need to be read in parallel. This is done by issuing one
/// ScanRange (in IssueInitialRanges()) for the file footer per split.
/// ProcessSplit() is called once for each original split and determines the row groups
/// whose midpoints fall within that split. We use the mid-point to determine whether a
/// row group should be processed because if the row group size is less than or equal to
/// the split size, the mid point guarantees that we have at least 50% of the row group in
/// the current split. ProcessSplit() then computes the column ranges for these row groups
/// and submits them to the IoMgr for immediate scheduling (so they don't surface in
/// RequestContext::GetNextUnstartedRange()). Scheduling them immediately also guarantees
/// they are all read at once.
///
/// Like the other scanners, each parquet scanner object is one to one with a
/// ScannerContext. Unlike the other scanners though, the context will have multiple
/// streams, one for each column. Row groups are processed one at a time this way.
///
/// ---- Nested types ----
/// This scanner supports reading and materializing nested data. For a good overview of
/// how nested data is encoded, see blog.twitter.com/2013/dremel-made-simple-with-parquet.
/// For how SQL nested schemas are translated to parquet schemas, see
/// github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/LogicalTypes.md#nested-types.
///
/// Examples:
/// For these examples, we will use the following table definition:
/// tbl:
///   id                bigint
///   array_col         array<array<int>>
///
/// The table definition could correspond to the following parquet schema (note the
/// required 'id' field. If written by Impala, all non-repeated fields would be optional,
/// but we can read repeated fields as well):
///
/// required group record         d=0 r=0
///   req int64 id                d=0 r=0
///   opt group array_col (LIST)  d=1 r=0
///     repeated group list       d=2 r=1
///       opt group item (LIST)   d=3 r=1
///         repeated group list   d=4 r=2
///           opt int32 item      d=5 r=2
///
/// Each element in the schema has been annotated with the maximum def level and maximum
/// rep level corresponding to that element. Note that the repeated elements add a def
/// level. This distinguishes between 0 items (empty list) and more than 0 items
/// (non-empty list). The containing optional LIST element for each array determines
/// whether the whole list is null or non-null. Maps work the same way, the only
/// differences being that the repeated group contains two child fields ("key" and "value"
/// instead of "item"), and the outer element is annotated with MAP instead of LIST.
///
/// Only scalar schema elements are materialized in parquet files; internal nested
/// elements can be reconstructed using the def and rep levels. To illustrate this, here
/// is data containing every valid definition and repetition for the materialized int
/// 'item' element. The data records appear on the left, the encoded definition levels,
/// repetition levels, and values for the 'item' field appear on the right (the encoded
/// 'id' field is not shown).
///
/// record                       d r v

///   The top-level row batch contains two slots, one containing the int64_t 'id' slot and

///   a single int 'item' slot.
///
///   Note that the scanner materializes a NULL CollectionValue for empty collections.

///
///   In this example, the scanner doesn't materialize a nested in-memory result, since

///   materialized for every rep and def level pair read -- there are 9 of these pairs
///   total in the sample data above, but only 5 tuples are materialized. This is because
///   in this case, nothing should be materialized for NULL or empty arrays, since we're

///
///   In this example, the scanner materializes a "flattened" version of inner, rather

///
/// ---- Slot materialization ----
/// Top-level tuples:
/// The slots of top-level tuples are populated in a column-wise fashion. Each column
/// reader materializes a batch of values into a temporary 'scratch batch'. Once a
/// scratch batch has been fully populated, runtime filters and conjuncts are evaluated
/// against the scratch tuples, and the surviving tuples are set in the output batch that
/// is handed to the scan node. The ownership of tuple memory is transferred from a
/// scratch batch to an output row batch once all tuples in the scratch batch have either
/// been filtered or returned as part of an output batch.
///
/// Collection items:
/// Unlike the top-level tuples, the item tuples of CollectionValues are populated in
/// a row-wise fashion because doing it column-wise has the following challenges.
/// First, we would need to allocate a scratch batch for every collection-typed slot
/// which could consume a lot of memory. Then we'd need a similar mechanism to transfer
/// tuples that survive conjuncts to an output collection. However, CollectionValues lack
/// the row indirection that row batches have, so we would need to either deep copy the
/// surviving tuples, or come up with a different mechanism altogether.
/// TODO: Populating CollectionValues in a column-wise fashion seems different enough
/// and less critical for most of our users today to defer this task until later.
///
/// ---- Runtime filters ----
/// HdfsParquetScanner is able to apply runtime filters that arrive before or during
/// scanning. Filters are applied at both the row group (see AssembleRows()) and row (see
/// ReadRow()) scope. If all filter predicates do not pass, the row or row group will be
/// excluded from output. Only partition-column filters are applied at AssembleRows(). The
/// FilterContexts for these filters are cloned from the parent scan node and attached to
/// the ScannerContext.
///
/// ---- Page filtering ----
/// A Parquet file can contain a so called "page index". It has two parts, a column index
/// and an offset index. The column index contains statistics like minimum and maximum
/// values for each page. The offset index contains information about page locations in
/// the Parquet file and top-level row ranges. HdfsParquetScanner evaluates the min/max
/// conjuncts against the column index and determines the surviving pages with the help of
/// the offset index. Then it will configure the column readers to only scan the pages
/// and row ranges that have a chance to store rows that pass the conjuncts.
