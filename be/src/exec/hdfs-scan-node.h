/// Legacy ScanNode implementation used in the non-multi-threaded execution mode
/// that is used for all tables read directly from HDFS-serialised data.
/// A HdfsScanNode spawns multiple scanner threads to process the bytes in
/// parallel.  There is a handshake between the scan node and the scanners
/// to get all the splits queued and bytes processed.
/// 1. The scan node initially calls the Scanner with a list of files and splits
///    for that scanner/file format.
/// 2. The scanner issues the initial byte ranges for each of those files.  For text
///    this is simply the entire range but for rc files, this would just be the header
///    byte range.  The scan node doesn't care either way.
/// 3. The scan node spins up a number of scanner threads. Each of those threads
///    pulls the next scan range to work on from the IoMgr and then processes the
///    range end to end.
/// 4. The scanner processes the buffers, issuing more scan ranges if necessary.
/// 5. The scanner finishes the scan range and informs the scan node so it can track
///    end of stream.
///
/// Buffer management:
/// ------------------
/// The different scanner threads all allocate I/O buffers from the node's Buffer Pool
/// client. The scan node ensures that enough reservation is available to start a
/// scanner thread before launching each one with, after which the scanner thread must
/// stay within the reservation handed off to it. Scanner threads can try to increase
/// their reservation if desired (e.g. for scanning columnar formats like Parquet), but
/// must be able to make progress within the initial reservation handed off from the scan
/// node.
///
/// TODO: Remove this class once the fragment-based multi-threaded execution is
/// fully functional.
