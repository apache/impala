/// Evaluates analytic functions with a single pass over input rows. It is assumed
/// that the input has already been sorted on all of the partition exprs and then the
/// order by exprs. If there is no order by clause or partition clause, the input is
/// unsorted. Uses a BufferedTupleStream to buffer input rows which are returned in a
/// streaming fashion as entire row batches of output are ready to be returned, though in
/// some cases the entire input must actually be consumed to produce any output rows.
///
/// The output row is composed of the tuples from the child node followed by a single
/// result tuple that holds the values of the evaluated analytic functions (one slot per
/// analytic function).
///
/// When enough input rows have been consumed to produce the results of all analytic
/// functions for one or more rows (e.g. because the order by values are different for a
/// RANGE window), the results of all the analytic functions for those rows are produced
/// in a result tuple by calling GetValue()/Finalize() on the evaluators and storing the
/// tuple in result_tuples_. Input row batches are fetched from the BufferedTupleStream,
/// copied into output row batches, and the associated result tuple is set in each
/// corresponding row. Result tuples may apply to many rows (e.g. an arbitrary number or
/// an entire partition) so result_tuples_ stores a pair of the stream index (the last
/// row in the stream it applies to) and the tuple.
///
/// Input rows are consumed in a streaming fashion until enough input has been consumed
/// in order to produce enough output rows. In some cases, this may mean that only a
/// single input batch is needed to produce the results for an output batch, e.g.
/// "SELECT RANK OVER (ORDER BY unique_col) ... ", but in other cases, an arbitrary
/// number of rows may need to be buffered before result rows can be produced, e.g. if
/// multiple rows have the same values for the order by exprs. The number of buffered
/// rows may be an entire partition or even the entire input. Therefore, the output
/// rows are buffered and may spill to disk via the BufferedTupleStream.
