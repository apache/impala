/// does not fit in memory. Spilled partitions can be repartitioned with a different

///
/// The builder owns the hash tables and build row streams. The builder first does the
/// level 0 partitioning of build rows. After FlushFinal() the builder has produced some
/// in-memory partitions and some spilled partitions. The in-memory partitions have hash
/// tables and the spilled partitions have memory reserved for a probe-side stream with
/// one write buffer, which is sufficient to spill the partition's probe rows to disk
/// without allocating additional buffers.
///
/// After this initial partitioning, the join node probes the in-memory hash partitions,
/// after which it calls DoneProbingHashPartitions(). Then the spilling algorithm can
/// commence, with the join node calling BeginSpilledProbe() and DoneProbing*() methods
/// until all spilled partitions are processed.
///
/// Both the PartitionedHashJoinNode and the builder share memory reservation. Different
/// stages of the spilling algorithm require different mixes of build and probe buffers
/// and hash tables, so we can share the reservation to minimize the combined memory
/// requirement. Memory for probe-side buffers is reserved in the builder then handed
/// off to the probe side to implement this reservation sharing. When the builder is
/// integrated into the join node, this is implemented with a shared BufferPool client.
/// When the build is separate, reservation is transferred between the builder's and the
/// join node's clients as needed. The probe client is passed into various methods as
/// 'probe_client'. If the join is integrated, 'probe_client' must be the same client
/// as was passed into the constructor. If the join is separate, 'probe_client' must
/// be a different client.
///
/// The full hash join algorithm is documented in PartitionedHashJoinNode.
///
/// Shared Build
/// ------------
/// A separate builder can be shared between multiple PartitionedHashJoinNodes. The
/// spilling hash join algorithm mutates the state of the builder between phases, so
/// requires synchronization between the probe threads executing PartitionedHashJoinNode
/// that are reading that state.
///
/// The algorithm (specifically the HashJoinState state machine) is executed in lockstep
/// across all probe threads with each probe thread working on the same set of partitions
/// at the same time. A CyclicBarrier, 'probe_barrier_', is used for synchronization.
/// At each state transition where the builder state needs to be mutated, all probe
/// threads must arrive at the barrier before proceeding. The state transition is executed
/// serially by a single thread before all threads proceed. All probe threads go through
/// the same state transitions in lockstep, even if they have no work to do. E.g. if a
/// probe thread has zero rows remaining in its spilled partitions, it still needs to
/// wait for the other probe threads.
///
/// Not all join ops can be used with a shared build. For example, RIGHT_OUTER_JOIN is
/// not supported currently, in part because it mutates the hash table during probing to
/// track matches, but also because hash table matches would need to be broadcast across
/// all instances within the query, not just the backend.
