/// The below sequence diagram shows an example of how the probe and build finstance
/// threads synchronize to do the nested loop join build, hand it off to the probe thread
/// and then release resources at the end. For simplicitly, this particular sequence
/// assumes that Prepare() was already called on the build finstance thread so
/// GetFInstanceState() returns immediately (otherwise Open() would block waiting for
/// the build finstance to be prepared).
