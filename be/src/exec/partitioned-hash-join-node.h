/// Operator to perform partitioned hash join, spilling to disk as necessary. This
/// operator implements multiple join modes with the same code algorithm.
///
/// The high-level algorithm is as follows:
///  1. Consume all build input and partition it. No hash tables are maintained.
///  2. Construct hash tables for as many unspilled partitions as possible.
///  3. Consume the probe input. Each probe row is hashed to find the corresponding build
///     partition. If the build partition is in-memory (i.e. not spilled), then the
///     partition's hash table is probed and any matching rows can be outputted. If the
///     build partition is spilled, the probe row must also be spilled for later
///     processing.
///  4. Any spilled partitions are processed. If the build rows and hash table for a
///     spilled partition fit in memory, the spilled partition is brought into memory
///     and its spilled probe rows are processed. Otherwise the spilled partition must be
///     repartitioned into smaller partitions. Repartitioning repeats steps 1-3 above,
///     except with the partition's spilled build and probe rows as input.
///
/// IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
/// -----------------------
/// The partitioned hash join algorithm is implemented with the PartitionedHashJoinNode
/// and PhjBuilder classes. Each join node has a builder (see PhjBuilder) that
/// partitions, stores and builds hash tables over the build rows.
///
/// The above algorithm is implemented as a state machine with the following phases:
///
///   1. [PARTITIONING_BUILD or REPARTITIONING_BUILD] Read build rows from child(1) OR
///      from the spilled build rows of a partition and partition them into the builder's
///      hash partitions. If there is sufficient memory, all build partitions are kept
///      in memory. Otherwise, build partitions are spilled as needed to free up memory.
///      Finally, build a hash table for each in-memory partition and create a probe
///      partition with a write buffer for each spilled partition.
///
///      After the phase, the algorithm advances from PARTITIONING_BUILD to
///      PARTITIONING_PROBE or from REPARTITIONING_BUILD to REPARTITIONING_PROBE.
///
///   2. [PARTITIONING_PROBE or REPARTITIONING_PROBE] Read the probe rows from child(0) or
///      a the spilled probe rows of a partition and partition them. If a probe row's
///      partition is in memory, probe the partition's hash table, otherwise spill the
///      probe row. Finally, output unmatched build rows for join modes that require it.
///
///      After the phase, the algorithm terminates if no spilled partitions remain or
///      continues to process one of the remaining spilled partitions by advancing to
///      either PROBING_SPILLED_PARTITION or REPARTITIONING_BUILD, depending on whether
///      the spilled partition's hash table fits in memory or not.
///
///   3. [PROBING_SPILLED_PARTITION] Read the probe rows from a spilled partition that
///      was brought back into memory and probe the partition's hash table. Finally,
///      output unmatched build rows for join modes that require it.
///
///      After the phase, the algorithm terminates if no spilled partitions remain or
///      continues to process one of the remaining spilled partitions by advancing to
///      either PROBING_SPILLED_PARTITION or REPARTITIONING_BUILD, depending on whether
///      the spilled partition's hash table fits in memory or not.
///
/// Null aware anti-join (NAAJ) extends the above algorithm by accumulating rows with
/// NULLs into several different streams, which are processed in a separate step to
/// produce additional output rows. The NAAJ algorithm is documented in more detail in
/// header comments for the null aware functions and data structures.
