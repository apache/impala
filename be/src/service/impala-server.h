/// An ImpalaServer contains both frontend and backend functionality;
/// it implements ImpalaService (Beeswax), ImpalaHiveServer2Service (HiveServer2)
/// and ImpalaInternalService APIs.
/// ImpalaServer can be started in 1 of 3 roles: executor, coordinator, or both executor
/// and coordinator. All roles start ImpalaInternalService API's. The
/// coordinator role additionally starts client API's (Beeswax and HiveServer2).
///
/// Startup Sequence
/// ----------------
/// The startup sequence opens and starts all services so that they are ready to be used
/// by clients at the same time. The Impala server is considered 'ready' only when it can
/// process requests with all of its specified roles. Avoiding states where some roles are
/// ready and some are not makes it easier to reason about the state of the server.
///
/// Main thread (caller code), after instantiating the server, must call Start().
/// Start() does the following:
///    - Registers the ImpalaServer instance with the ExecEnv. This also registers it with
///      the ClusterMembershipMgr, which will register it with the statestore as soon as
///      the local backend becomes available through GetLocalBackendDescriptor(), which is
///      in turn gated by the services_started_.
///    - Start internal services
///    - Wait (indefinitely) for local catalog to be initialized from statestore
///      (if coordinator)
///    - Open ImpalaInternalService ports
///    - Open client ports (if coordinator)
///    - Start ImpalaInternalService API
///    - Start client service API's (if coordinator)
///    - Set services_started_ flag
///
///
/// Shutdown
/// --------
/// Impala Server shutdown can be initiated by a remote shutdown command from another
/// Impala daemon or by a local shutdown command from a user session. The shutdown
/// sequence aims to quiesce the Impalad (i.e. drain it of any running finstances or
/// client requests) then exit the process cleanly. The shutdown sequence is as follows:
///
/// 1. StartShutdown() is called to initiate the process.
/// 2. The startup grace period starts, during which:
///   - no new client requests are accepted. Clients can still interact with registered
///     requests and sessions as normal.
///   - the local backend of the Impala daemon is marked in the statestore as quiescing,
///     so coordinators will not schedule new fragments on it (once the statestore update
///     propagates through the ClusterMembershipMgr).
///   - the Impala daemon continues to start executing any new fragments sent to it by
///     coordinators. This is required because the query may have been submitted before
///     the coordinator learned that the executor was quiescing. Delays occur for several
///     reasons:
///     -> Latency of membership propagation through the statestore
///     -> Latency of query startup work including scheduling, admission control and
///        fragment startup.
///     -> Queuing delay in the admission controller (which may be unbounded).
/// 3. The startup grace period elapses.
/// 4. The background shutdown thread periodically checks to see if the Impala daemon is
///    quiesced (i.e. no client requests are registered and no queries are executing on
///    the backend). If it is quiesced then it cleanly shuts down by exiting the process.
///    The statestore will detect that the process is not responding to heartbeats and
///    remove any entries.
/// 5. The shutdown deadline elapses. The Impala daemon exits regardless of whether
///    it was successfully quiesced or not.
///
/// If shutdown is initiated again during this process, it does not cancel the existing
/// shutdown but can decrease the deadline, e.g. if an administrator starts shutdown
/// with a deadline of 1 hour, but then wants to shut down the cluster sooner, they can
/// run the shutdown function again to set a shorter deadline. The deadline can't be
/// increased after shutdown is started.
///
/// Secrets
/// -------
/// The HS2 protocol has a concept of a 'secret' associated with each session and
/// client request that is returned to the client, then must be passed back along with
/// each RPC that interacts with the session or operation. RPCs with non-matching secrets
/// should fail. Beeswax does not have this concept - rather sessions are bound to a
/// connection, and that session and associated requests should (generally) only be
/// accessed from the session's connection.
///
/// All RPC handler functions are responsible for validating secrets when looking up
/// client sessions or requests, with some exceptions:
/// * Beewax sessions are tied to a connection, so it is always valid to access the
///   session from the original connection.
/// * Cancel() and close() Beeswax operations can cancel any query if the ID is known.
///   Existing tools (impala-shell and administrative tools) depend on this behaviour.
///
/// HS2 RPC handlers should pass the client-provided secret to WithSession() before
/// taking any action on behalf of the client. Beeswax RPC handlers should call
/// CheckClientRequestSession() to ensure that the client request is accessible from
/// the current session. All other functions assume that the validation was already done.
///
/// HTTP handlers do not have access to client secrets, so do not validate them.
///
/// Locking
/// -------
/// This class is partially thread-safe. To ensure freedom from deadlock, if multiple
/// locks are acquired, lower-numbered locks must be acquired before higher-numbered
/// locks:
/// 1. session_state_map_lock_
/// 2. SessionState::lock
/// 3. query_expiration_lock_
/// 4. ClientRequestState::fetch_rows_lock
/// 5. ClientRequestState::lock
/// 6. ClientRequestState::expiration_data_lock_
/// 7. Coordinator::exec_summary_lock
///
/// The following locks are not held in conjunction with other locks:
/// * query_log_lock_
/// * session_timeout_lock_
/// * query_locations_lock_
/// * uuid_lock_
/// * catalog_version_lock_
/// * connection_to_sessions_map_lock_
///
/// TODO: The same doesn't apply to the execution state of an individual plan
/// fragment: the originating coordinator might die, but we can get notified of
/// that via the statestore. This still needs to be implemented.
