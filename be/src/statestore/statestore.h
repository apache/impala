/// The Statestore is a soft-state key-value store that maintains a set of Topics, which
/// are maps from string keys to byte array values.
///
/// Topics are subscribed to by subscribers, which are remote clients of the statestore
/// which express an interest in some set of Topics. The statestore sends topic updates to
/// subscribers via periodic 'update' messages, and also sends periodic 'heartbeat'
/// messages, which are used to detect the liveness of a subscriber. Updates for each
/// topic are delivered sequentially to each subscriber per subscription. E.g. if a
/// subscriber is subscribed to a topic "foo", the statestore will not deliver topic
/// updates for "foo" out-of-order or concurrently, but the updates may be sent
/// concurrently or out-of-order with "bar".
///
/// In response to 'update' messages, subscribers, send topic updates to the statestore to
/// merge with the current topic. These updates are then sent to all other subscribers in
/// their next update message. The next message is scheduled update_frequency in the
/// future, unless the subscriber indicated that it skipped processing an update, in which
/// case the statestore will back off slightly before re-sending a new update. The
/// update frequency is determined by FLAGS_statestore_update_frequency_ms or
/// FLAGS_statestore_priority_update_frequency, depending on whether the topic is a
/// prioritized topic.
///
/// Prioritized topics are topics that are small but important to delivery in a timely
/// manner. Handling those topics in a separate threadpool prevents large updates of other
/// topics slowing or blocking dissemination of updates to prioritized topics.
///
/// Topic entries usually have human-readable keys, and values which are some serialised
/// representation of a data structure, e.g. a Thrift struct. The contents of a value's
/// byte string is opaque to the statestore, which maintains no information about how to
/// deserialise it. Subscribers must use convention to interpret each other's updates.
///
/// A subscriber may have marked some updates that it made as 'transient', which implies
/// that those entries should be deleted once the subscriber is no longer connected (this
/// is judged by the statestore's failure-detector, which will mark a subscriber as failed
/// when it has not responded to a number of successive heartbeat messages). Transience
/// is tracked per-topic-per-subscriber, so two different subscribers may treat the same
/// topic differently wrt to the transience of their updates.
///
/// The statestore tracks the history of updates to each topic, with each topic update
/// getting a sequentially increasing version number that is unique across the topic.
///
/// Subscribers also track the max version of each topic which they have have successfully
/// processed. The statestore can use this information to send a delta of updates to a
/// subscriber, rather than all items in the topic.  For non-delta updates, the statestore
/// will send an update that includes all values in the topic.
///
/// Subscribers may filter the keys within a subscribed topic by an optional prefix. If
/// a key filter prefix is specified, only entries matching that prefix will be sent to
/// the subscriber in updates. Note that this may result in empty updates being sent
/// to subscribers in the case that all updated keys have been excluded by the filter.
/// These empty updates are important so that subscribers can keep track of the current
/// version number and report back their progress in receiving the topic contents.
