/// A BloomFilter stores sets of items and offers a query operation indicating whether or
/// not that item is in the set.  BloomFilters use much less space than other compact data
/// structures, but they are less accurate: for a small percentage of elements, the query
/// operation incorrectly returns true even when the item is not in the set.
///
/// When talking about Bloom filter size, rather than talking about 'size', which might be
/// ambiguous, we distinguish two different quantities:
///
/// 1. Space: the amount of heap memory used
///
/// 2. NDV: the number of unique items that have been inserted
///
/// BloomFilter is implemented using block Bloom filters from Putze et al.'s "Cache-,
/// Hash- and Space-Efficient Bloom Filters". The basic idea is to hash the item to a tiny
/// Bloom filter the size of a single cache line or smaller. This implementation sets 8
/// bits in each tiny Bloom filter. This provides a false positive rate near optimal for
/// between 5 and 15 bits per distinct value, which corresponds to false positive
/// probabilities between 0.1% (for 15 bits) and 10% (for 5 bits).
///
