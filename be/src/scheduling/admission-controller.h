/// The AdmissionController is used to throttle requests (e.g. queries, DML) based
/// on available cluster resources, which are configured in one or more resource pools. A
/// request will either be admitted for immediate execution, queued for later execution,
/// or rejected (either immediately or after being queued). Resource pools can be
/// configured to have maximum number of concurrent queries, maximum cluster wide memory,
/// maximum queue size, max and min per host memory limit for every query, and to set
/// whether the mem_limit query option will be clamped by the previously mentioned max/min
/// per host limits or not. Queries will be queued if there are already too many queries
/// executing or there isn't enough available memory. Once the queue reaches the maximum
/// queue size, incoming queries will be rejected. Requests in the queue will time out
/// after a configurable timeout.
///
/// Depending on the -is_coordinator startup flag, multiple impalads can act as a
/// coordinator and thus also an admission controller, so some cluster state must be
/// shared between impalads in order to make admission decisions on any of them. Every
/// coordinator maintains some per-pool and per-host statistics related to the requests it
/// itself is servicing as the admission controller. Some of these local admission
/// statistics in addition to some backend-specific statistics (i.e. the backend executor
/// associated with the same impalad process) are disseminated across the cluster via the
/// statestore using the IMPALA_REQUEST_QUEUE_TOPIC topic. Effectively, coordinators send
/// statestore updates where the admission statistics reflect the load and all
/// participating backends send statestore updates reflecting the load they're executing.
///
/// Every <impalad, pool> pair is sent as a topic update at the statestore heartbeat
/// interval when pool statistics change, and the topic updates from other impalads are
/// used to re-compute the aggregate per-pool stats. Because the pool statistics are only
/// updated on statestore heartbeats and all decisions are made with the cached state,
/// the aggregate pool statistics are only estimates. As a result, more requests may be
/// admitted or queued than the configured thresholds, which are really soft limits.
///
/// Memory resources:
/// A pool may be configured to allow a maximum amount of memory resources to be
/// 'reserved' by requests admitted to that pool. While Impala does not yet truly
/// 'reserve' the memory at admission (i.e. Impala does not yet guarantee the memory for
/// a request, it is still possible to overadmit such that multiple queries think they
/// have reserved the same memory), the admission controller uses several metrics to
/// estimate the available memory and admit only when it thinks the necessary memory is
/// available. Future work will enable real reservations, but this is a much larger
/// effort and will involve changes outside of the admission controller.
///
/// The memory required for admission for a request is specified as the query option
/// MEM_LIMIT (either explicitly or via a default value). This is a per-host value. If
/// there is no memory limit, the per-host estimate from planning is used instead as a
/// memory limit and a lower bound is enforced on it based on the largest initial
/// reservation of the query. The final memory limit used is also clamped by the max/min
/// memory limits configured for the pool with an option to not enforce these limits on
/// the MEM_LIMIT query option (If both these max/min limits are not configured, then the
/// estimates from planning are not used as a memory limit and are only used for making
/// admission decisions. Moreover the estimates will no longer have a lower bound based on
/// the largest initial reservation).
/// The following four conditions must hold in order for the request to be admitted:
///  1) The current pool configuration is valid.
///  2) There must be enough memory resources available in this resource pool for the
///     request. The max memory resources configured for the resource pool specifies the
///     aggregate, cluster-wide memory that may be reserved by all executing queries in
///     this pool. Thus the aggregate memory to be reserved across all participating
///     backends for this request, *plus* that of already admitted requests must be less
///     than or equal to the max resources specified.
///  3) All participating backends must have enough memory available. Each impalad has a
///     per-process mem limit, and that is the max memory that can be reserved on that
///     backend.
///  3b) (optional) When using executor groups (see below) and admitting to the
///     non-default executor group, then the number of currently running queries must be
///     below the configured maximum for all participating backends.
///  4) The final per host memory limit used can accommodate the largest initial
///     reservation.
///
/// In order to admit based on these conditions, the admission controller accounts for
/// the following on both a per-host and per-pool basis:
///  a) Mem Reserved: the amount of memory that has been reported as reserved by all
///     backends, which come from the statestore topic updates. The values that are sent
///     come from the pool mem trackers in UpdateMemTrackerStats(), which reflects the
///     memory reserved by fragments that have begun execution. For queries that are
///     executing and have mem limits, the limit is considered to be its reserved memory
///     because it may consume up to that limit. Otherwise the query's current consumption
///     is used (see MemTracker::GetPoolMemReserved()). The per-pool and per-host
///     aggregates are computed in UpdateClusterAggregates(). This state, once all updates
///     are fully distributed and aggregated, provides enough information to make
///     admission decisions by any impalad. However, this requires waiting for both
///     admitted requests to start all remote fragments and then for the updated state to
///     be distributed via the statestore.
///  b) Mem Admitted: the amount of memory required (i.e. the value used in admission,
///     either the mem limit or estimate) for the requests that this impalad's admission
///     controller has admitted. Both the per-pool and per-host accounting is updated
///     when requests are admitted and released (and NOTE: not via the statestore, so
///     there is no latency, but this does not account for memory from requests admitted
///     by other impalads).
///  c) Num Admitted: the number of queries that have been admitted and are therefore
///     considered to be currently running. Note that there is currently no equivalent to
///     the reserved memory reporting, i.e. hosts do not report the actual number of
///     queries that are currently executing (IMPALA-8762). This prevents using multiple
///     coordinators with executor groups.
///
/// As described, both the 'reserved' and 'admitted' mem accounting mechanisms have
/// different advantages and disadvantages. The 'reserved' mem accounting works well in
/// the steady state, i.e. given enough time to distribute updates. The 'admitted'
/// mem accounting works perfectly when there is a single coordinator (and perhaps works
/// reasonably with just a few). The maximum of the reserved and admitted mem is used in
/// making admission decisions, which works well when either relatively few coordinators
/// are used or, if there is a wide distribution of requests across impalads, the rate of
/// submission is low enough that new state is able to be updated by the statestore.
///
/// Releasing Queries:
/// When queries complete they must be explicitly released from the admission controller
/// using the methods 'ReleaseQuery' and 'ReleaseQueryBackends'. These methods release
/// the admitted memory and decrement the number of admitted queries for the resource
/// pool. All Backends for a query must be released via 'ReleaseQueryBackends' before the
/// query is released using 'ReleaseQuery'. Releasing Backends releases the admitted
/// memory used by that Backend and decrements the number of running queries on the host
/// running that Backend. Releasing a query does not release any admitted memory, it only
/// decrements the number of running queries in the resource pool.
///
/// Executor Groups:
/// Executors in a cluster can be assigned to executor groups. Each executor can only be
/// in one group. A resource pool can have multiple executor groups associated with it.
/// Each executor group belongs to a single resource pool and will only serve requests
/// from that pool. I.e. the relationships are 1 resource pool : many executor groups and
/// 1 executor group : many executors.
///
/// Executors that don't specify an executor group name during startup are automatically
/// added to a default group called DEFAULT_EXECUTOR_GROUP_NAME. The default executor
/// group does not enforce query concurrency limits per host and as such can be admitted
/// to by multiple coordinators.
///
/// Executor groups are mapped to resource pools implicitly by their name. Queries in a
/// resource pool can run on all executor groups whose name starts with the pool's name,
/// separated by a '-'. For example, queries in a pool with name 'q1' can run on all
/// executor groups starting with 'q1-'. If no matching executor groups can be found for a
/// resource pool and the default executor group is not empty, then the default group is
/// used.
///
/// In addition to the checks described before, admission to executor groups is bounded by
/// the maximum number of queries that can run concurrently on an executor
/// (-admission_control_slots). An additional check is performed to ensure that each
/// executor in the group has an available slot to run the query. Admission controllers
/// include the number of queries that have been admitted to each executor in the
/// statestore updates.
///
/// In order to find an executor group that can run a query, the admission controller
/// calls FindGroupToAdmitOrReject(), either during the initial admission attempt or in
/// DequeueLoop(). If the cluster membership has changed, it (re-)computes schedules for
/// all executor groups and then tries to admit queries using the list of schedules.
/// Admission is always attempted in the same order so that executor groups fill up before
/// further ones are considered. In particular, we don't attempt to balance the queries
/// across executor groups.
///
/// Example without executor groups:
/// Consider a 10-node cluster with 100gb/node and a resource pool 'q1' configured with
/// 500gb of aggregate memory and 40gb as the max memory limit. An incoming request with
/// the MEM_LIMIT query option set to 50gb and scheduled to execute on all backends is
/// received by SubmitForAdmission() on an otherwise quiet cluster. Based on the pool
/// configuration, a per host mem limit of 40gb is used for this query and for any
/// subsequent checks that it needs to pass prior to admission. FindGroupToAdmitOrReject()
/// computes a schedule for the default executor group and performs rejection tests before
/// calling CanAdmitRequest(), which checks the number of running queries and then calls
/// HasAvailableMemResources() to check for memory resources. It first checks whether
/// there is enough memory for the request using PoolStats::EffectiveMemReserved() (which
/// is the max of the pool's agg_mem_reserved_ and local_mem_admitted_, see #1 above),
/// then checks for enough memory on each individual host via the max of mem_reserved and
/// mem_admitted in hosts_stats_ (see #2 above) and finally checks if the memory limit
/// used for this query can accommodate its largest initial reservation. In this case,
/// ample resources are available so CanAdmitRequest() returns true. PoolStats::Admit() is
/// called to update q1's PoolStats: it first updates agg_num_running_ and
/// local_mem_admitted_ which are available to be used immediately for incoming admission
/// requests, then it updates num_admitted_running in the struct sent to the statestore
/// (local_stats_). UpdateHostStats() is called to update the per-host admitted mem
/// (stored in the map host_stats_) for all participating hosts. Then SubmitForAdmission()
/// returns to the ClientRequestState. If another identical admission request is received
/// by the same coordinator immediately, it will be rejected because q1's
/// local_mem_admitted_ is already 400gb. If that request were sent to another impalad at
/// the same time, it would have been admitted because not all updates have been
/// disseminated yet. The next statestore update will contain the updated value of
/// num_admitted_running for q1 on this backend. As remote fragments begin execution on
/// remote impalads, their pool mem trackers will reflect the updated amount of memory
/// reserved (set in local_stats_.backend_mem_reserved by UpdateMemTrackerStats()) and the
/// next statestore updates coming from those impalads will contain the updated value. As
/// the statestore updates are received (in the subscriber callback fn UpdatePoolStats()),
/// the incoming per-backend, per-pool mem_reserved values are aggregated to
/// PoolStats::agg_mem_reserved_ (pool aggregate over all hosts) and backend_mem_reserved_
/// (per-host aggregates over all pools). Once this has happened, any incoming admission
/// request now has the updated state required to make correct admission decisions.
///
/// Example with executor groups:
/// Consider a cluster with a dedicated coordinator and 2 executor groups
/// "default-pool-group-1" and "default-pool-group-2" (the number of executors per group
/// does not matter for this example). Both executor groups will be able to serve requests
/// from the default resource pool. Consider that each executor has only one admission
/// slot i.e. --admission_control_slots=1 is specified for all executors. An incoming
/// query with mt_dop=1 is submitted through SubmitForAdmission(), which calls
/// FindGroupToAdmitOrReject(). From there we call ComputeGroupScheduleStates() which
/// calls compute schedules for both executor groups. Then we perform rejection tests and
/// afterwards call CanAdmitRequest() for each of the schedules. Executor groups are
/// processed in alphanumerically sorted order, so we attempt admission to group
/// "default-pool-group-1" first. CanAdmitRequest() calls HasAvailableSlots() to check
/// whether any of the hosts in the group can fit the new query in their available slots
/// and since it does fit, admission succeeds. The query is admitted and 'slots_in_use'
/// is incremented for each host in that group based on the effective parallelism of the
/// query. When a second query arrives while the first one is still running, we perform
/// the same steps. In particular we compute schedules for both groups and consider
/// admission to default-pool-group-1 first. However, the check in HasAvailableSlots()
/// now fails and we will consider group default-pool-group-2 next. For this group,
/// the check succeeds and the query is admitted, incrementing the num_admitted counter
/// for each host in group default-pool-group-2.
///
/// Queuing Behavior:
/// Once the resources in a pool are consumed, each coordinator receiving requests will
/// begin queuing. While each individual queue is FIFO, there is no total ordering on the
/// queued requests between admission controllers and no FIFO behavior is guaranteed for
/// requests submitted to different coordinators. When resources become available, there
/// is no synchronous coordination between nodes used to determine which get to dequeue
/// and admit requests. Instead, we use a simple heuristic to try to dequeue a number of
/// requests proportional to the number of requests that are waiting in each individual
/// admission controller to the total number of requests queued across all admission
/// controllers (i.e. impalads). This limits the amount of overadmission that may result
/// from a large amount of resources becoming available at the same time. When there are
/// requests queued in multiple pools on the same host, the admission controller simply
/// iterates over the pools in pool_stats_ and attempts to dequeue from each. This is fine
/// for the max_requests limit, but is unfair for memory-based admission because the
/// iteration order of pools effectively gives priority to the queues at the beginning.
/// Requests across queues may be competing for the same resources on particular hosts,
/// i.e. #2 in the description of memory-based admission above. Note the pool's
/// max_mem_resources (#1) is not contented.
///
/// Cancellation Behavior:
/// An admission request<schedule, admit_outcome> submitted using SubmitForAdmission() can
/// be proactively cancelled by setting the 'admit_outcome' to
/// AdmissionOutcome::CANCELLED. This is handled asynchronously by SubmitForAdmission()
/// and DequeueLoop().
///
/// Pool Configuration Mechanism:
/// The path to pool config files are specified using the startup flags
/// "fair_scheduler_allocation_path" and "llama_site_path". The format for specifying pool
/// configs is based on yarn and llama with additions specific to Impala. A file
/// monitoring service is started that monitors changes made to these files. Those changes
/// are only propagated to Impala when a new query is serviced. See RequestPoolService
/// class for more details.
