  /// distance' of each executor is considered. The concept of memory distance reflects
  /// the cost of moving data into the processing executor's main memory. Reading from
  /// cached replicas is generally considered less costly than reading from a local disk,
  /// which in turn is cheaper than reading data from a remote node. If multiple executors
  /// of the same memory distance are found, then the one with the least amount of
  /// previously assigned work is picked, thus aiming to distribute the work as evenly as
  /// possible.

  /// Finally, scan ranges are considered which do not have an impalad executor running on
  /// any of their data nodes. They will be load-balanced by assigned bytes across all
  /// executors.

  ///

  ///   setting this to DISK_LOCAL, all cached replicas will be treated as if they were
  ///   not cached, but local disk replicas. This can help prevent hot-spots by spreading
  ///   the assignments over more replicas. Allowed values are CACHE_LOCAL (default),
  ///   DISK_LOCAL and REMOTE.
  ///
  /// disable_cached_reads:
  ///   Setting this value to true is equivalent to setting replica_preference to
  ///   DISK_LOCAL and takes precedence over replica_preference. The default setting is
  ///   false.
  ///
  /// schedule_random_replica:
  ///   When equivalent executors with a memory distance of DISK_LOCAL are found for a
  ///   scan range (same memory distance, same amount of assigned work), then the first
  ///   one will be picked deterministically. This aims to make better use of OS buffer
  ///   caches, but can lead to performance bottlenecks on individual hosts. Setting this
  ///   option to true will randomly change the order in which equivalent replicas are
  ///   picked for different plan nodes. This helps to compute a more even assignment,
  ///   with the downside being an increased memory usage for OS buffer caches. The
  ///   default setting is false. Selection between equivalent replicas with memory
  ///   distance of CACHE_LOCAL or REMOTE happens based on a random order.
  ///
  /// The method takes the following parameters:
