/// The ClusterMembershipMgr manages the local backend's membership in the cluster. It has
/// two roles:
///   - Provide a consistent view on the current cluster membership, i.e. other backends
///   - Establish and maintain the membership of the local backend in the cluster.
///
/// To do this, the class subscribes to the statestore cluster-membership topic and
/// applies incoming changes to its local copy of the cluster state. If it finds that the
/// local backend is missing from the cluster membership, it will add it (contingent on
/// the local backend being available after startup).
///
/// Clients of this class can obtain a consistent, immutable snapshot of the cluster
/// membership state through GetSnapshot().
///
/// The ClusterMembershipMgr keeps the membership snapshot stable while the statestore
/// subscriber is recovering from a connection failure. This allows other backends to
/// re-register with the statestore after a statestore restart.
///
/// TODO(IMPALA-8484): Allow specifying executor groups during backend startup. Currently
/// only one executor group named "default" exists. All backends are part of that group
/// and it's the only group available for scheduling.
///
/// The class also allows the local backend (ImpalaServer), the local Frontend and the
/// AdmissionController to register callbacks to receive notifications of changes to the
/// cluster membership. Note: The notifications for blacklisted executors are not sent
/// immediately, but deferred to when statestore updates are processed (see detailed
/// comment in the BlacklistExecutor method in the cc file). These callbacks are
/// registered before the statestore subscriber is started by the impala server which
/// ensures that the very first update to the cluster membership is sent to all callbacks.
///
/// TODO: Replace the usage of shared_ptr with atomic_shared_ptr once compilers support
///       it. Alternatively consider using Kudu's rw locks.
