// An RpcSidecar is a mechanism which allows replies to RPCs to reference blocks of data
// without extra copies. In other words, whenever a protobuf would have a large field
// where additional copies become expensive, one may opt instead to use an RpcSidecar.
//
// The RpcSidecar saves on an additional copy to/from the protobuf on both the server and
// client side. Both Inbound- and OutboundCall classes accept sidecars to be sent to the
// client and server respectively. They are ignorant of the sidecar's format, requiring
// only that it can be represented as a Slice. Data is copied from the Slice returned from
// AsSlice() to the socket that is responding to the original RPC. The slice should remain
// valid for as long as the call it is attached to takes to complete.
//
// In order to distinguish between separate sidecars, whenever a sidecar is added to the
// RPC response on the server side, an index for that sidecar is returned. This index must
// then in some way (i.e., via protobuf) be communicated to the recipient.
//
// After reconstructing the array of sidecars, servers and clients may retrieve the
// sidecar data through the RpcContext or RpcController interfaces respectively.
