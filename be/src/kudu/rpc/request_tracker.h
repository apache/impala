// RequestTracker implementation, inspired by:
// "Implementing Linearizability at Large Scale and Low Latency" by Colin Lee et al.
//
// This generates sequence numbers for retriable RPCs and tracks the ongoing ones.
// The main point of this is to enable exactly-once semantics, i.e. making sure that
// an RPC is only executed once, by uniquely identifying each RPC that is sent to
// the server.
//
// Note that the sequence numbers here are differet from RPC 'call ids'. A call id
// uniquely identifies a call _to a server_. All calls have a call id that is
// assigned incrementally. Sequence numbers, on the other hand, uniquely identify
// the RPC operation itself. That is, if an RPC is retried on another server it will
// have a different call id, but the same sequence number.
//
// By keeping track of the RPCs that are in-flight and which ones are completed
// we can determine the first incomplete RPC. When this information is sent
// to the server it can use it to garbage collect RPC results that it might be
// saving for future retries, since it now knows there won't be any.
//
// This class is thread safe.
