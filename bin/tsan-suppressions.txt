# This file suppresses TSAN errors, following
# https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerSuppressions

# This method in Boost's UUID library operates on static state with impunity,
# triggering (harmless) data races in TSAN when boost::uuids::random_generator
# instances are created across threads (this suppression and the corresponding
# explanation were copied from Kudu's sanitizer_options.cc).
