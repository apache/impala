# This script runs clang-tidy on the backend, excluding gutil and kudu/. clang-tidy finds
# bugs and likely bugs.
#
# To use this script, the toolchain must be installed and the toolchain environment

# The output of this script is quite verbose becuase clang-tidy and the clang-provided
# run-clang-tidy.py have verbose output. The lines indicating likely bugs are the ones
# that end in ']'.
