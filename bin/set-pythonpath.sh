# Sets up the python path for impala-python3. This is needed because tests and other
# utility scripts depend on some modules external to infra/python/env-*.
# TODO: we should try to reduce our reliance on PYTHONPATH if possible.
#
# Used to allow importing testdata, test, etc modules from other scripts.

# ${IMPALA_HOME}/bin has bootstrap_toolchain.py, required by bootstrap_virtualenv.py
export PYTHONPATH=${IMPALA_HOME}:${IMPALA_HOME}/bin

# Generated Thrift files are used by tests and other scripts.
