      <p class="p">
        Impala can interoperate with data stored in Hive, and uses the same infrastructure as
        Hive for tracking metadata about schema objects such as tables and columns. The
        following components are prerequisites for Impala:
      </p>


      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">
          MySQL or PostgreSQL, to act as a metastore database for both Impala and Hive.
          <p class="p">
            Always configure a <strong class="ph b">Hive metastore service</strong> rather than connecting directly to
            the metastore database. The Hive metastore service is required to interoperate
            between different levels of metastore APIs if this is necessary for your
            environment, and using it avoids known issues with connecting directly to the
            metastore database.
          </p>

          <p class="p">
            See below for a summary of the metastore installation process.
          </p>

        </li>


        <li class="li">
          Hive (optional). Although only the Hive metastore database is required for Impala to
          function, you might install Hive on some client machines to create and load data into
          tables that use certain file formats. See
          <a class="xref" href="impala_file_formats.html#file_formats">How Impala Works with Hadoop File Formats</a> for details. Hive does not need to
          be installed on the same DataNodes as Impala; it just needs access to the same
          metastore database.
        </li>

      </ul>


      <p class="p">
        To install the metastore:
      </p>


      <ol class="ol">
        <li class="li">
          Install a MySQL or PostgreSQL database. Start the database if it is not started after
          installation.
        </li>


        <li class="li">
          Download the
          <a class="xref" href="http://www.mysql.com/products/connector/" target="_blank">MySQL
          connector</a> or the
          <a class="xref" href="http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html" target="_blank">PostgreSQL
          connector</a> and place it in the <code class="ph codeph">/usr/share/java/</code> directory.
        </li>


        <li class="li">
          Use the appropriate command line tool for your database to create the metastore
          database.
        </li>


        <li class="li">
          Use the appropriate command line tool for your database to grant privileges for the
          metastore database to the <code class="ph codeph">hive</code> user.
        </li>


        <li class="li">
          Modify <code class="ph codeph">hive-site.xml</code> to include information matching your particular
          database: its URL, username, and password. You will copy the
          <code class="ph codeph">hive-site.xml</code> file to the Impala Configuration Directory later in the
          Impala installation process.

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        Although Impala is primarily written in C++, it does use Java to communicate with
        various Hadoop components:

      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">
          The officially supported JVM for Impala is the Oracle JVM. Other JVMs might cause
          issues, typically resulting in a failure at <span class="keyword cmdname">impalad</span> startup. In
          particular, the JamVM used by default on certain levels of Ubuntu systems can cause
          <span class="keyword cmdname">impalad</span> to fail to start.
        </li>


        <li class="li">
          Internally, the <span class="keyword cmdname">impalad</span> daemon relies on the
          <code class="ph codeph">JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable to locate the system Java libraries.
          Make sure the <span class="keyword cmdname">impalad</span> service is not run from an environment with
          an incorrect setting for this variable.

        <li class="li">
          All Java dependencies are packaged in the <code class="ph codeph">impala-dependencies.jar</code>
          file, which is located at <code class="ph codeph">/usr/lib/impala/lib/</code>. These map to

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title5">Networking Configuration Requirements</h2>




    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        As part of ensuring best performance, Impala attempts to complete tasks on local data,
        as opposed to using network connections to work with remote data. To support this goal,
        Impala matches the <strong class="ph b">hostname</strong> provided to each Impala daemon with the <strong class="ph b">IP
        address</strong> of each DataNode by resolving the hostname flag to an IP address. For
        Impala to work with local data, use a single IP interface for the DataNode and the
        Impala daemon on each machine. Ensure that the Impala daemon's hostname flag resolves to
        the IP address of the DataNode. For single-homed machines, this is usually automatic,
        but for multi-homed machines, ensure that the Impala daemon's hostname resolves to the
        correct interface. Impala tries to detect the correct hostname at start-up, and prints
        the derived hostname at the start of the log in a message of the form:
      </p>


<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Using hostname: impala-daemon-1.example.com</code></pre>

      <p class="p">
        In the majority of cases, this automatic detection works correctly. If you need to
        explicitly set the hostname, do so by setting the <code class="ph codeph">--hostname</code> flag.

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title6">Hardware Requirements</h2>


    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        The memory allocation should be consistent across Impala executor nodes. A single Impala
        executor with a lower memory limit than the rest can easily become a bottleneck and lead
        to suboptimal performance.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        This guideline does not apply to coordinator-only nodes.

      <h3 class="title topictitle3" id="ariaid-title7">Hardware Requirements for Optimal Join Performance</h3>


      <div class="body conbody">

        <p class="p">
          During join operations, portions of data from each joined table are loaded into
          memory. Data sets can be very large, so ensure your hardware has sufficient memory to
          accommodate the joins you anticipate completing.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          While requirements vary according to data set size, the following is generally
          recommended:
        </p>


        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li">
            CPU
            <p class="p">
              Impala version 2.2 and higher uses the SSSE3 instruction set, which is included in
              newer processors.
            </p>


            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>
              This required level of processor is the same as in Impala version 1.x. The Impala
              2.0 and 2.1 releases had a stricter requirement for the SSE4.1 instruction set,
              which has now been relaxed.
            </div>


          </li>


          <li class="li">
            Memory
            <p class="p">
              128 GB or more recommended, ideally 256 GB or more. If the intermediate results
              during query processing on a particular node exceed the amount of memory available
              to Impala on that node, the query writes temporary work data to disk, which can
              lead to long query times. Note that because the work is parallelized, and
              intermediate results for aggregate queries are typically smaller than the original
              data, Impala can query and join tables that are much larger than the memory
              available on an individual node.
            </p>

          <li class="li">
            JVM Heap Size for Catalog Server
            <p class="p">
              4 GB or more recommended, ideally 8 GB or more, to accommodate the maximum numbers
              of tables, partitions, and data files you are planning to use with Impala.
            </p>

          </li>


          <li class="li">
            Storage
            <p class="p">
              DataNodes with 12 or more disks each. I/O speeds are often the limiting factor for
              disk performance with Impala. Ensure that you have sufficient disk space to store
              the data Impala will be querying.

      <p class="p">
        Impala creates and uses a user and group named <code class="ph codeph">impala</code>. Do not delete
        this account or group and do not modify the account's or group's permissions and rights.
        Ensure no existing systems obstruct the functioning of these accounts and groups. For
        example, if you have scripts that delete user accounts not in a white-list, add these
        accounts to the list of permitted accounts.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        For correct file deletion during <code class="ph codeph">DROP TABLE</code> operations, Impala must be
        able to move files to the HDFS trashcan. You might need to create an HDFS directory
        <span class="ph filepath">/user/impala</span>, writeable by the <code class="ph codeph">impala</code> user, so
        that the trashcan can be created. Otherwise, data files might remain behind after a
        <code class="ph codeph">DROP TABLE</code> statement.

      <p class="p">
        Impala should not run as root. Best Impala performance is achieved using direct reads,
        but root is not permitted to use direct reads. Therefore, running Impala as root
        negatively affects performance.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        By default, any user can connect to Impala and access all the associated databases and
        tables. You can enable authorization and authentication based on the Linux OS user who
        connects to the Impala server, and the associated groups for that user.
        <a class="xref" href="impala_security.html#security">Impala Security</a> for details. These security features do not
        change the underlying file permission requirements; the <code class="ph codeph">impala</code> user
