      Deletes an arbitrary number of rows from a Kudu table.
      This statement only works for Impala tables that use the Kudu storage engine.

        <strong class="ph b">Syntax:</strong>
      </p>


<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
DELETE [FROM] [<var class="keyword varname">database_name</var>.]<var class="keyword varname">table_name</var> [ WHERE <var class="keyword varname">where_conditions</var> ]

DELETE <var class="keyword varname">table_ref</var> FROM [<var class="keyword varname">joined_table_refs</var>] [ WHERE <var class="keyword varname">where_conditions</var> ]
</code></pre>

    <p class="p">
      The first form evaluates rows from one table against an optional
      <code class="ph codeph">WHERE</code> clause, and deletes all the rows that
      match the <code class="ph codeph">WHERE</code> conditions, or all rows if
      <code class="ph codeph">WHERE</code> is omitted.
    </p>


    <p class="p">
      The second form evaluates one or more join clauses, and deletes
      all matching rows from one of the tables. The join clauses can
      include non-Kudu tables, but the table from which the rows
      are deleted must be a Kudu table. The <code class="ph codeph">FROM</code>
      keyword is required in this case, to separate the name of
      the table whose rows are being deleted from the table names
      of the join clauses.
    </p>


    <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">Usage notes:</strong>
      </p>


    <p class="p">
      The conditions in the <code class="ph codeph">WHERE</code> clause are the same ones allowed
      for the <code class="ph codeph">SELECT</code> statement. See <a class="xref" href="impala_select.html#select">SELECT Statement</a>
      for details.
    </p>


    <p class="p">
      The conditions in the <code class="ph codeph">WHERE</code> clause can refer to
      any combination of primary key columns or other columns. Referring to
      primary key columns in the <code class="ph codeph">WHERE</code> clause is more efficient
      than referring to non-primary key columns.
    </p>


    <p class="p">
      If the <code class="ph codeph">WHERE</code> clause is omitted, all rows are removed from the table.
    </p>


    <p class="p">
      Because Kudu currently does not enforce strong consistency during concurrent DML operations,
      be aware that the results after this statement finishes might be different than you
      intuitively expect:
    </p>

    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">
        <p class="p">
          If some rows cannot be deleted because their
          some primary key columns are not found, due to their being deleted
          by a concurrent <code class="ph codeph">DELETE</code> operation,
          the statement succeeds but returns a warning.
        </p>

      </li>

      <li class="li">
        <p class="p">
          A <code class="ph codeph">DELETE</code> statement might also overlap with
          <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code>, <code class="ph codeph">UPDATE</code>,
          or <code class="ph codeph">UPSERT</code> statements running concurrently on the same table.
          After the statement finishes, there might be more or fewer rows than expected in the table
          because it is undefined whether the <code class="ph codeph">DELETE</code> applies to rows that are
          inserted or updated while the <code class="ph codeph">DELETE</code> is in progress.
        </p>

      </li>

    </ul>


    <p class="p">
      The number of affected rows is reported in an <span class="keyword cmdname">impala-shell</span> message
      and in the query profile.

    <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> 
        After adding or replacing data in a table used in performance-critical queries, issue a
        <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE STATS</code> statement to make sure all statistics are up-to-date.
        Consider updating statistics for a table after any <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code>, <code class="ph codeph">LOAD
        DATA</code>, or <code class="ph codeph">CREATE TABLE AS SELECT</code> statement in Impala, or after
        loading data through Hive and doing a <code class="ph codeph">REFRESH
        <var class="keyword varname">table_name</var></code> in Impala. This technique is especially important
        for tables that are very large, used in join queries, or both.

    <p class="p">
      The following examples show how to delete rows from a specified
      table, either all rows or rows that match a <code class="ph codeph">WHERE</code>
      clause:
    </p>


<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
-- Deletes all rows. The FROM keyword is optional.
DELETE FROM kudu_table;
DELETE kudu_table;

-- Deletes 0, 1, or more rows.
-- (If c1 is a single-column primary key, the statement could only
-- delete 0 or 1 rows.)
DELETE FROM kudu_table WHERE c1 = 100;

-- Deletes all rows that match all the WHERE conditions.
DELETE FROM kudu_table WHERE
  (c1 &gt; c2 OR c3 IN ('hello','world')) AND c4 IS NOT NULL;
DELETE FROM t1 WHERE
  (c1 IN (1,2,3) AND c2 &gt; c3) OR c4 IS NOT NULL;
DELETE FROM time_series WHERE
  year = 2016 AND month IN (11,12) AND day &gt; 15;

-- WHERE condition with a subquery.
DELETE FROM t1 WHERE
  c5 IN (SELECT DISTINCT other_col FROM other_table);

-- Does not delete any rows, because the WHERE condition is always false.
DELETE FROM kudu_table WHERE 1 = 0;
</code></pre>

    <p class="p">
      The following examples show how to delete rows that are part
      of the result set from a join:

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
-- Remove _all_ rows from t1 that have a matching X value in t2.
DELETE t1 FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.x = t2.x;

DELETE t1 FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.x = t2.x
  WHERE t1.y = FALSE and t2.z &gt; 100;

-- Delete from a Kudu table based on a join with a non-Kudu table.
DELETE t1 FROM kudu_table t1 JOIN non_kudu_table t2 ON t1.x = t2.x;

-- The tables can be joined in any order as long as the Kudu table
-- is specified as the deletion target.
DELETE t2 FROM non_kudu_table t1 JOIN kudu_table t2 ON t1.x = t2.x;
