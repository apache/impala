  <h1 class="title topictitle1" id="ariaid-title1">WITH Clause</h1>

  

  <div class="body conbody">

    <p class="p">
      A clause that can be added before a <code class="ph codeph">SELECT</code> statement, to define aliases for complicated
      expressions that are referenced multiple times within the body of the <code class="ph codeph">SELECT</code>. Similar to
      <code class="ph codeph">CREATE VIEW</code>, except that the table and column names defined in the <code class="ph codeph">WITH</code>
      clause do not persist after the query finishes, and do not conflict with names used in actual tables or
      views. Also known as <span class="q">"subquery factoring"</span>.
    </p>


    <p class="p">
      You can rewrite a query using subqueries to work the same as with the <code class="ph codeph">WITH</code> clause. The
      purposes of the <code class="ph codeph">WITH</code> clause are:
    </p>


    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">
        Convenience and ease of maintenance from less repetition with the body of the query. Typically used with
        queries involving <code class="ph codeph">UNION</code>, joins, or aggregation functions where the similar complicated
        expressions are referenced multiple times.
      </li>


      <li class="li">
        SQL code that is easier to read and understand by abstracting the most complex part of the query into a
        separate block.
      </li>


      <li class="li">
        Improved compatibility with SQL from other database systems that support the same clause (primarily Oracle
        Database).
        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>
          <p class="p">
            The Impala <code class="ph codeph">WITH</code> clause does not support recursive queries in the
            <code class="ph codeph">WITH</code>, which is supported in some other database systems.
