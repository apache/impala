      <dfn class="term">Complex types</dfn> (also referred to as <dfn class="term">nested types</dfn>) let you represent multiple data values within a single

      <dfn class="term">scalar types</dfn> or <dfn class="term">primitive types</dfn>, which represent a single data value within a given row/column position.

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title2">Benefits of Impala Complex Types</h2>


    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        The reasons for using Impala complex types include the following:
      </p>


      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">
          <p class="p">
            You already have data produced by Hive or other non-Impala component that uses the complex type column names. You might need to
            convert the underlying data to Parquet to use it with Impala.
          </p>

        </li>


        <li class="li">
          <p class="p">
            Your data model originates with a non-SQL programming language or a NoSQL data management system. For example, if you are
            representing Python data expressed as nested lists, dictionaries, and tuples, those data structures correspond closely to Impala
            <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code>, <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code>, and <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> types.
          </p>

        </li>


        <li class="li">
          <p class="p">
            Your analytic queries involving multiple tables could benefit from greater locality during join processing. By packing more
            related data items within each HDFS data block, complex types let join queries avoid the network overhead of the traditional
            Hadoop shuffle or broadcast join techniques.
          </p>

        </li>

      </ul>


      <p class="p">
        The Impala complex type support produces result sets with all scalar values, and the scalar components of complex types can be used
        with all SQL clauses, such as <code class="ph codeph">GROUP BY</code>, <code class="ph codeph">ORDER BY</code>, all kinds of joins, subqueries, and inline
        views. The ability to process complex type data entirely in SQL reduces the need to write application-specific code in Java or other
        programming languages to deconstruct the underlying data structures.

  <div class="topic concept nested1" aria-labelledby="ariaid-title3" id="complex_types_overview">

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title3">Overview of Impala Complex Types</h2>


    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">

        The <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> and <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code> types are closely related: they represent collections with arbitrary numbers of
        elements, where each element is the same type. In contrast, <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> groups together a fixed number of items into a
        single element. The parts of a <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> element (the <dfn class="term">fields</dfn>) can be of different types, and each field
        has a name.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        The elements of an <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> or <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code>, or the fields of a <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code>, can also be other
        complex types. You can construct elaborate data structures with up to 100 levels of nesting. For example, you can make an
        <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> whose elements are <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code>s. Within each <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code>, you can have some fields
        that are <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code>, <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code>, or another kind of <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code>. The Impala documentation uses the
        terms complex and nested types interchangeably; for simplicity, it primarily uses the term complex types, to encompass all the
        properties of these types.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        When visualizing your data model in familiar SQL terms, you can think of each <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> or <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code> as a
        miniature table, and each <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> as a row within such a table. By default, the table represented by an
        <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> has two columns, <code class="ph codeph">POS</code> to represent ordering of elements, and <code class="ph codeph">ITEM</code>
        representing the value of each element. Likewise, by default, the table represented by a <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code> encodes key-value
        pairs, and therefore has two columns, <code class="ph codeph">KEY</code> and <code class="ph codeph">VALUE</code>.

      </p>


      <p class="p">
        The <code class="ph codeph">ITEM</code> and <code class="ph codeph">VALUE</code> names are only required for the very simplest kinds of <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code>
        and <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code> columns, ones that hold only scalar values. When the elements within the <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> or
        <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code> are of type <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> rather than a scalar type, then the result set contains columns with names
        corresponding to the <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> fields rather than <code class="ph codeph">ITEM</code> or <code class="ph codeph">VALUE</code>.
      </p>




      <p class="p">
        You write most queries that process complex type columns using familiar join syntax, even though the data for both sides of the join
        resides in a single table. The join notation brings together the scalar values from a row with the values from the complex type
        columns for that same row. The final result set contains all scalar values, allowing you to do all the familiar filtering,
        aggregation, ordering, and so on for the complex data entirely in SQL or using business intelligence tools that issue SQL queries.

      </p>


      <p class="p">
        Behind the scenes, Impala ensures that the processing for each row is done efficiently on a single host, without the network traffic
        involved in broadcast or shuffle joins. The most common type of join query for tables with complex type columns is <code class="ph codeph">INNER
        JOIN</code>, which returns results only in those cases where the complex type contains some elements. Therefore, most query
        examples in this section use either the <code class="ph codeph">INNER JOIN</code> clause or the equivalent comma notation.
      </p>


      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>
        <p class="p">
          Although Impala can query complex types that are present in Parquet files, Impala currently cannot create new Parquet files
          containing complex types. Therefore, the discussion and examples presume that you are working with existing Parquet data produced
          through Hive, Spark, or some other source. See <a class="xref" href="#complex_types_ex_hive_etl">Constructing Parquet Files with Complex Columns Using Hive</a> for examples of constructing Parquet data
          files with complex type columns.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          For learning purposes, you can create empty tables with complex type columns and practice query syntax, even if you do not have
          sample data with the required structure.

      <h3 class="title topictitle3" id="ariaid-title5">How Complex Types Differ from Traditional Data Warehouse Schemas</h3>


      <div class="body conbody">

        <p class="p">
          Complex types let you associate arbitrary data structures with a particular row. If you are familiar with schema design for
          relational database management systems or data warehouses, a schema with complex types has the following differences:
        </p>


        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li">
            <p class="p">
              Logically, related values can now be grouped tightly together in the same table.
            </p>


            <p class="p">
              In traditional data warehousing, related values were typically arranged in one of two ways:
            </p>

            <ul class="ul">
              <li class="li">
                <p class="p">
                  Split across multiple normalized tables. Foreign key columns specified which rows from each table were associated with
                  each other. This arrangement avoided duplicate data and therefore the data was compact, but join queries could be
                  expensive because the related data had to be retrieved from separate locations. (In the case of distributed Hadoop
                  queries, the joined tables might even be transmitted between different hosts in a cluster.)
                </p>

              </li>


              <li class="li">
                <p class="p">
                  Flattened into a single denormalized table. Although this layout eliminated some potential performance issues by removing
                  the need for join queries, the table typically became larger because values were repeated. The extra data volume could
                  cause performance issues in other parts of the workflow, such as longer ETL cycles or more expensive full-table scans
                  during queries.
                </p>

              </li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p">
              Complex types represent a middle ground that addresses these performance and volume concerns. By physically locating related
              data within the same data files, complex types increase locality and reduce the expense of join queries. By associating an
              arbitrary amount of data with a single row, complex types avoid the need to repeat lengthy values such as strings. Because
              Impala knows which complex type values are associated with each row, you can save storage by avoiding artificial foreign key
              values that are only used for joins. The flexibility of the <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code>, <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code>, and
              <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code> types lets you model familiar constructs such as fact and dimension tables from a data warehouse, and
              wide tables representing sparse matrixes.

      <div class="body conbody">

        <p class="p">
          Physically, the scalar and complex columns in each row are located adjacent to each other in the same Parquet data file, ensuring
          that they are processed on the same host rather than being broadcast across the network when cross-referenced within a query. This
          co-location simplifies the process of copying, converting, and backing all the columns up at once. Because of the column-oriented
          layout of Parquet files, you can still query only the scalar columns of a table without imposing the I/O penalty of reading the
          (possibly large) values of the composite columns.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          Within each Parquet data file, the constituent parts of complex type columns are stored in column-oriented format:

          Currently, Impala queries support complex type data only in the Parquet file format. See <a class="xref" href="impala_parquet.html#parquet">Using the Parquet File Format with Impala Tables</a>

        </p>


        <p class="p">
          Because Impala does not parse the data structures containing nested types for unsupported formats such as text, Avro,
          SequenceFile, or RCFile, you cannot use data files in these formats with Impala, even if the query does not refer to the nested
          type columns. Also, if a table using an unsupported format originally contained nested type columns, and then those columns were
          dropped from the table using <code class="ph codeph">ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN</code>, any existing data files in the table still contain the
          nested type data and Impala queries on that table will generate errors.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
            The one exception to the preceding rule is <code class="ph codeph">COUNT(*)</code> queries on RCFile tables that include complex types.

        <p class="p">
          You can perform DDL operations for tables involving complex types in

          Impala with complex types using text files.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          You can have a partitioned table with complex type columns that uses
          a non-Parquet format, and use <code class="ph codeph">ALTER TABLE</code> to change
          the file format to Parquet for individual partitions. When you put
          Parquet data files into those partitions, Impala can execute queries
          against that data as long as the query does not involve any of the
          non-Parquet partitions.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          If you use the <span class="keyword cmdname">parquet-tools</span> command to examine the structure of a Parquet data file that includes complex

          Choosing between multiple normalized fact and dimension tables, or a single table containing complex types, is an important design

                  Complex types avoid the possibility of expensive join queries when data from fact and dimension tables is processed in
                  parallel across multiple hosts. All the information for a row containing complex types is typically to be in the same data
                  block, and therefore does not need to be transmitted across the network when joining fields that are all part of the same
                  row.

                <p class="p">
                  The tradeoff with complex types is that fewer rows fit in each data block. Whether it is better to have more data blocks
                  with fewer rows, or fewer data blocks with many rows, depends on the distribution of your data and the characteristics of
                  your query workload. If the complex columns are rarely referenced, using them might lower efficiency. If you are seeing
                  low parallelism due to a small volume of data (relatively few data blocks) in each table partition, increasing the row
                  size by including complex columns might produce more data blocks and thus spread the work more evenly across the cluster.

      <h3 class="title topictitle3" id="ariaid-title9">Differences Between Impala and Hive Complex Types</h3>


      <div class="body conbody">

        <p class="p">
          Impala can query Parquet tables containing <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code>, <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code>, and <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code> columns
          produced by Hive. There are some differences to be aware of between the Impala SQL and HiveQL syntax for complex types, primarily
          for queries.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
          Impala supports a subset of the syntax that Hive supports for
          specifying <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code>, <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code>, and
            <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code> types in the <code class="ph codeph">CREATE TABLE</code>
          statements.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          Because Impala <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> columns include user-specified field names, you use the <code class="ph codeph">NAMED_STRUCT()</code>
          constructor in Hive rather than the <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT()</code> constructor when you populate an Impala <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code>
          column using a Hive <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code> statement.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          The Hive <code class="ph codeph">UNION</code> type is not currently supported in Impala.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          While Impala usually aims for a high degree of compatibility with HiveQL query syntax, Impala syntax differs from Hive for queries
          involving complex types. The differences are intended to provide extra flexibility for queries involving these kinds of tables.
        </p>


        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li">
            Impala uses dot notation for referring to element names or elements within complex types, and join notation for
            cross-referencing scalar columns with the elements of complex types within the same row, rather than the <code class="ph codeph">LATERAL
            VIEW</code> clause and <code class="ph codeph">EXPLODE()</code> function of HiveQL.
          </li>


          <li class="li">
            Using join notation lets you use all the kinds of join queries with complex type columns. For example, you can use a
            <code class="ph codeph">LEFT OUTER JOIN</code>, <code class="ph codeph">LEFT ANTI JOIN</code>, or <code class="ph codeph">LEFT SEMI JOIN</code> query to evaluate
            different scenarios where the complex columns do or do not contain any elements.
          </li>


          <li class="li">
            You can include references to collection types inside subqueries and inline views. For example, you can construct a
            <code class="ph codeph">FROM</code> clause where one of the <span class="q">"tables"</span> is a subquery against a complex type column, or use a subquery
            against a complex type column as the argument to an <code class="ph codeph">IN</code> or <code class="ph codeph">EXISTS</code> clause.
          </li>


          <li class="li">
            The Impala pseudocolumn <code class="ph codeph">POS</code> lets you retrieve the position of elements in an array along with the elements
            themselves, equivalent to the <code class="ph codeph">POSEXPLODE()</code> function of HiveQL. You do not use index notation to retrieve a
            single array element in a query; the join query loops through the array elements and you use <code class="ph codeph">WHERE</code> clauses to
            specify which elements to return.
          </li>


          <li class="li">
            <p class="p">
              Join clauses involving complex type columns do not require an <code class="ph codeph">ON</code> or <code class="ph codeph">USING</code> clause. Impala
              implicitly applies the join key so that the correct array entries or map elements are associated with the correct row from the
              table.
            </p>

          </li>


          <li class="li">
            <p class="p">

      <h3 class="title topictitle3" id="ariaid-title10">Limitations and Restrictions for Complex Types</h3>


      <div class="body conbody">

        <p class="p">
          Complex type columns can only be used in tables or partitions with the Parquet file format.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          Complex type columns cannot be used as partition key columns in a partitioned table.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          When you use complex types with the <code class="ph codeph">ORDER BY</code>, <code class="ph codeph">GROUP BY</code>, <code class="ph codeph">HAVING</code>, or
          <code class="ph codeph">WHERE</code> clauses, you cannot refer to the column name by itself. Instead, you refer to the names of the scalar
          values within the complex type, such as the <code class="ph codeph">ITEM</code>, <code class="ph codeph">POS</code>, <code class="ph codeph">KEY</code>, or
          <code class="ph codeph">VALUE</code> pseudocolumns, or the field names from a <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code>.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          The maximum depth of nesting for complex types is 100 levels.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
            The maximum length of the column definition for any complex type, including declarations for any nested types,
            is 4000 characters.
          </p>


        <p class="p">
          For ideal performance and scalability, use small or medium-sized collections, where all the complex columns contain at most a few
          hundred megabytes per row. Remember, all the columns of a row are stored in the same HDFS data block, whose size in Parquet files
          typically ranges from 256 MB to 1 GB.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          Including complex type columns in a table introduces some overhead that might make queries that do not reference those columns
          somewhat slower than Impala queries against tables without any complex type columns. Expect at most a 2x slowdown compared to
          tables that do not have any complex type columns.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          Currently, the <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE STATS</code> statement does not collect any statistics for columns containing complex types.
          Impala uses heuristics to construct execution plans involving complex type columns.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          Currently, Impala built-in functions and user-defined functions cannot accept complex types as parameters or produce them as
          function return values. (When the complex type values are materialized in an Impala result set, the result set contains the scalar
          components of the values, such as the <code class="ph codeph">POS</code> or <code class="ph codeph">ITEM</code> for an <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code>, the
          <code class="ph codeph">KEY</code> or <code class="ph codeph">VALUE</code> for a <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code>, or the fields of a <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code>; these
          scalar data items <em class="ph i">can</em> be used with built-in functions and UDFs as usual.)
        </p>


        <p class="p">
        Impala currently cannot write new data files containing complex type columns.
        Therefore, although the <code class="ph codeph">SELECT</code> statement works for queries
        involving complex type columns, you cannot use a statement form that writes
        data to complex type columns, such as <code class="ph codeph">CREATE TABLE AS SELECT</code> or <code class="ph codeph">INSERT ... SELECT</code>.
        To create data files containing complex type data, use the Hive <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code> statement, or another
        ETL mechanism such as MapReduce jobs, Spark jobs, Pig, and so on.
      </p>


        <p class="p">
          Currently, Impala can query complex type columns only from Parquet tables or Parquet partitions within partitioned tables.
          Although you can use complex types in tables with Avro, text, and other file formats as part of your ETL pipeline, for example as
          intermediate tables populated through Hive, doing analytics through Impala requires that the data eventually ends up in a Parquet
          table. The requirement for Parquet data files means that you can use complex types with Impala tables hosted on other kinds of
          file storage systems such as Isilon and Amazon S3, but you cannot use Impala to query complex types from HBase tables. See
          <a class="xref" href="impala_complex_types.html#complex_types_file_formats">File Format Support for Impala Complex Types</a> for more details.

          the <code class="ph codeph">ALTER TABLE ... SET FILEFORMAT</code> statement does not

        <p class="p">

          existing Parquet file, including complex type columns for nested data structures. Remember to include the <code class="ph codeph">STORED AS

          For example, when defining a table that holds contact information, you might represent phone numbers differently depending on the
          expected layout and relationships of the data, and how well you can predict those properties in advance.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          Here are different ways that you might represent phone numbers in a traditional relational schema, with equivalent representations
          using complex types.
        </p>


        <div class="fig fignone" id="nested_types_ddl__complex_types_phones_flat_fixed"><span class="figcap"><span class="fig--title-label">Figure 1. </span>Traditional Relational Representation of Phone Numbers: Single Table</span>

          

          <p class="p">
            The traditional, simplest way to represent phone numbers in a relational table is to store all contact info in a single table,
            with all columns having scalar types, and each potential phone number represented as a separate column. In this example, each
            person can only have these 3 types of phone numbers. If the person does not have a particular kind of phone number, the
            corresponding column is <code class="ph codeph">NULL</code> for that row.
          </p>


<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
CREATE TABLE contacts_fixed_phones
(
    id BIGINT
  , name STRING
  , address STRING
  , home_phone STRING

          <p class="p">
            Using a complex type column to represent the phone numbers adds some extra flexibility. Now there could be an unlimited number
            of phone numbers. Because the array elements have an order but not symbolic names, you could decide in advance that
            phone_number[0] is the home number, [1] is the work number, [2] is the mobile number, and so on. (In subsequent examples, you
            will see how to create a more flexible naming scheme using other complex type variations, such as a <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code> or an
            <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> where each element is a <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code>.)
          </p>


<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>

          <p class="p">
            Another way to represent an arbitrary set of phone numbers is with a <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code> column. With a <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code>,
            each element is associated with a key value that you specify, which could be a numeric, string, or other scalar type. This
            example uses a <code class="ph codeph">STRING</code> key to give each phone number a name, such as <code class="ph codeph">'home'</code> or
            <code class="ph codeph">'mobile'</code>. A query could filter the data based on the key values, or display the key values in reports.

          <p class="p">
            If you are an experienced database designer, you already know how to work around the limitations of the single-table schema from
            <a class="xref" href="#nested_types_ddl__complex_types_phones_flat_fixed">Figure 1</a>. By normalizing the schema, with the phone numbers in their own
            table, you can associate an arbitrary set of phone numbers with each person, and associate additional details with each phone
            number, such as whether it is a home, work, or mobile phone.
          </p>


          <p class="p">
            The flexibility of this approach comes with some drawbacks. Reconstructing all the data for a particular person requires a join
            query, which might require performance tuning on Hadoop because the data from each table might be transmitted from a different
            host. Data management tasks such as backups and refreshing the data require dealing with multiple tables instead of a single
            table.
          </p>


          <p class="p">
            This example illustrates a traditional database schema to store contact info normalized across 2 tables. The fact table
            establishes the identity and basic information about person. A dimension table stores information only about phone numbers,
            using an ID value to associate each phone number with a person ID from the fact table. Each person can have 0, 1, or many
            phones; the categories are not restricted to a few predefined ones; and the phone table can contain as many columns as desired,
            to represent all sorts of details about each phone number.

          <p class="p">
            To represent a schema equivalent to the one from <a class="xref" href="#nested_types_ddl__complex_types_phones_flat_normalized">Figure 4</a> using
            complex types, this example uses an <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> where each array element is a <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code>. As with the
            earlier complex type examples, each person can have an arbitrary set of associated phone numbers. Making each array element into
            a <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> lets us associate multiple data items with each phone number, and give a separate name and type to
            each data item. The <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> fields of the <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> elements reproduce the columns of the dimension
            table from the previous example.
          </p>


          <p class="p">
            You can do all the same kinds of queries with the complex type schema as with the normalized schema from the previous example.
            The advantages of the complex type design are in the areas of convenience and performance. Now your backup and ETL processes
            only deal with a single table. When a query uses a join to cross-reference the information about a person with their associated
            phone numbers, all the relevant data for each row resides in the same HDFS data block, meaning each row can be processed on a
            single host without requiring network transmission.

        <p class="p">
        Impala currently cannot write new data files containing complex type columns.
        Therefore, although the <code class="ph codeph">SELECT</code> statement works for queries

        data to complex type columns, such as <code class="ph codeph">CREATE TABLE AS SELECT</code> or <code class="ph codeph">INSERT ... SELECT</code>.
        To create data files containing complex type data, use the Hive <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code> statement, or another

          <p class="p">
            When complex types are nested inside each other, you use a combination of joins, pseudocolumn names, and dot notation to refer
            to specific fields at the appropriate level. This is the most frequent form of query syntax for complex columns, because the
            typical use case involves two levels of complex types, such as an <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> of <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> elements.

          <p class="p">
            You can express relationships between <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> and <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code> columns at different levels as joins. You
            include comparison operators between fields at the top level and within the nested type columns so that Impala can do the

          <p class="p">
            The <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code> data type is suitable for representing sparse or wide data structures, where each row might only have
            entries for a small subset of named fields. Because the element names (the map keys) vary depending on the row, a query must be
            able to refer to both the key and the value parts of each key-value pair. The <code class="ph codeph">KEY</code> and <code class="ph codeph">VALUE</code>
            pseudocolumns let you refer to the parts of the key-value pair independently within the query, as
            <code class="ph codeph"><var class="keyword varname">map_column</var>.KEY</code> and <code class="ph codeph"><var class="keyword varname">map_column</var>.VALUE</code>.
          </p>


          <p class="p">
            The <code class="ph codeph">KEY</code> must always be a scalar type, such as <code class="ph codeph">STRING</code>, <code class="ph codeph">BIGINT</code>, or
            <code class="ph codeph">TIMESTAMP</code>. It can be <code class="ph codeph">NULL</code>. Values of the <code class="ph codeph">KEY</code> field are not necessarily unique
            within the same <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code>. You apply any required <code class="ph codeph">DISTINCT</code>, <code class="ph codeph">GROUP BY</code>, and other
            clauses in the query, and loop through the result set to process all the values matching any specified keys.
          </p>


          <p class="p">
            The <code class="ph codeph">VALUE</code> can be either a scalar type or another complex type. If the <code class="ph codeph">VALUE</code> is a
            <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code>, you can construct a qualified name
            <code class="ph codeph"><var class="keyword varname">map_column</var>.VALUE.<var class="keyword varname">struct_field</var></code> to refer to the individual fields inside
            the value part. If the <code class="ph codeph">VALUE</code> is an <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> or another <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code>, you must include
            another join condition that establishes a table alias for <code class="ph codeph"><var class="keyword varname">map_column</var>.VALUE</code>, and then
            construct another qualified name using that alias, for example <code class="ph codeph"><var class="keyword varname">table_alias</var>.ITEM</code> or
            <code class="ph codeph"><var class="keyword varname">table_alias</var>.KEY</code> and <code class="ph codeph"><var class="keyword varname">table_alias</var>.VALUE</code>
          </p>


          <p class="p">
            The following example shows different ways to access a <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code> column using the <code class="ph codeph">KEY</code> and
            <code class="ph codeph">VALUE</code> pseudocolumns. The <code class="ph codeph">DETAILS</code> column has a <code class="ph codeph">STRING</code> first part with short,
            standardized values such as <code class="ph codeph">'Recurring'</code>, <code class="ph codeph">'Lucid'</code>, or <code class="ph codeph">'Anxiety'</code>. This is the
            <span class="q">"key"</span> that is used to look up particular kinds of elements from the <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code>. The second part, also a
            <code class="ph codeph">STRING</code>, is a longer free-form explanation. Impala gives you the standard pseudocolumn names
            <code class="ph codeph">KEY</code> and <code class="ph codeph">VALUE</code> for the two parts, and you apply your own conventions and interpretations to the
            underlying values.
          </p>


          <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>
            If you find that the single-item nature of the <code class="ph codeph">VALUE</code> makes it difficult to model your data accurately, the
            solution is typically to add some nesting to the complex type. For example, to have several sets of key-value pairs, make the
            column an <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> whose elements are <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code>. To make a set of key-value pairs that holds more
            elaborate information, make a <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code> column whose <code class="ph codeph">VALUE</code> part contains an <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code>
            or a <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code>.

      <h3 class="title topictitle3" id="ariaid-title19">Loading Data Containing Complex Types</h3>


      <div class="body conbody">

        <p class="p">
          Because the Impala <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code> statement does not currently support creating new data with complex type columns, or
          copying existing complex type values from one table to another, you primarily use Impala to query Parquet tables with complex
          types where the data was inserted through Hive, or create tables with complex types where you already have existing Parquet data
          files.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          If you have created a Hive table with the Parquet file format and containing complex types, use the same table for Impala queries
          with no changes. If you have such a Hive table in some other format, use a Hive <code class="ph codeph">CREATE TABLE AS SELECT ... STORED AS
          PARQUET</code> or <code class="ph codeph">INSERT ... SELECT</code> statement to produce an equivalent Parquet table that Impala can query.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          If you have existing Parquet data files containing complex types, located outside of any Impala or Hive table, such as data files
          created by Spark jobs, you can use an Impala <code class="ph codeph">CREATE TABLE ... STORED AS PARQUET</code> statement, followed by an Impala
          <code class="ph codeph">LOAD DATA</code> statement to move the data files into the table. As an alternative, you can use an Impala
          <code class="ph codeph">CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE</code> statement to create a table pointing to the HDFS directory that already contains the data
          files.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          Perhaps the simplest way to get started with complex type data is to take a denormalized table containing duplicated values, and
          use an <code class="ph codeph">INSERT ... SELECT</code> statement to copy the data into a Parquet table and condense the repeated values into
          complex types. With the Hive <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code> statement, you use the <code class="ph codeph">COLLECT_LIST()</code>,
          <code class="ph codeph">NAMED_STRUCT()</code>, and <code class="ph codeph">MAP()</code> constructor functions within a <code class="ph codeph">GROUP BY</code> query to
          produce the complex type values. <code class="ph codeph">COLLECT_LIST()</code> turns a sequence of values into an <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code>.
          <code class="ph codeph">NAMED_STRUCT()</code> uses the first, third, and so on arguments as the field names for a <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code>, to
          match the field names from the <code class="ph codeph">CREATE TABLE</code> statement.
        </p>


        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>
          Because Hive currently cannot construct individual rows using complex types through the <code class="ph codeph">INSERT ... VALUES</code> syntax,
          you prepare the data in flat form in a separate table, then copy it to the table with complex columns using <code class="ph codeph">INSERT ...
          SELECT</code> and the complex type constructors. See <a class="xref" href="impala_complex_types.html#complex_types_ex_hive_etl">Constructing Parquet Files with Complex Columns Using Hive</a> for

        </p>


        <p class="p">
          For example, to model a relationship like a dimension table and a fact table, you typically use an <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> where
          each array element is a <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code>. The <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> fields represent what would traditionally be columns
          in a separate joined table. It makes little sense to use a <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> as the top-level type for a column, because you
          could just make the fields of the <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> into regular table columns.
        </p>




        <p class="p">
          Perhaps the only use case for a top-level <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> would be to to allow <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> fields with the
          same name as columns to coexist in the same table. The following example shows how a table could have a column named
          <code class="ph codeph">ID</code>, and two separate <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> fields also named <code class="ph codeph">ID</code>. Because the
          <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> fields are always referenced using qualified names, the identical <code class="ph codeph">ID</code> names do not cause a
          conflict.
        </p>


<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>CREATE TABLE struct_namespaces
(
  id BIGINT
  , s1 STRUCT &lt; id: BIGINT, field1: STRING &gt;
  , s2 STRUCT &lt; id: BIGINT, when_happened: TIMESTAMP &gt;
)
STORED AS PARQUET;

select id, s1.id, s2.id from struct_namespaces;

</code></pre>

        <p class="p">
          It is common to make the value portion of each key-value pair in a <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code> a <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code>,
          <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> of <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code>, or other complex type variation. That way, each key in the <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code>
          can be associated with a flexible and extensible data structure. The key values are not predefined ahead of time (other than by
          specifying their data type). Therefore, the <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code> can accomodate a rapidly evolving schema, or sparse data
          structures where each row contains only a few data values drawn from a large set of possible choices.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          Although you can use an <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> of scalar values as the top-level column in a table, such a simple array is
          typically of limited use for analytic queries. The only property of the array elements, aside from the element value, is the
          ordering sequence available through the <code class="ph codeph">POS</code> pseudocolumn. To record any additional item about each array element,
          such as a <code class="ph codeph">TIMESTAMP</code> or a symbolic name, you use an <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> of <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> rather than
          of scalar values.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          If you are considering having multiple <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> or <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code> columns, with related items under the same
          position in each <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> or the same key in each <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code>, prefer to use a <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> to
          group all the related items into a single <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> or <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code>. Doing so avoids the additional storage
          overhead and potential duplication of key values from having an extra complex type column. Also, because each
          <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> or <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code> that you reference in the query <code class="ph codeph">SELECT</code> list requires an additional
          join clause, minimizing the number of complex type columns also makes the query easier to read and maintain, relying more on dot
          notation to refer to the relevant fields rather than a sequence of join clauses.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          For example, here is a table with several complex type columns all at the top level and containing only scalar types. To retrieve
          every data item for the row requires a separate join for each <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> or <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code> column. The fields of
          the <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> can be referenced using dot notation, but there is no real advantage to using the
          <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> at the top level rather than just making separate columns <code class="ph codeph">FIELD1</code> and
          <code class="ph codeph">FIELD2</code>.

      <div class="body conbody">

        <p class="p">
          The layout of complex and nested types is largely a physical consideration. The complex type columns reside in the same data files
          rather than in separate normalized tables, for your convenience in managing related data sets and performance in querying related
          data sets. You can use views to treat tables with complex types as if they were flattened. By putting the join logic and
          references to the complex type columns in the view definition, you can query the same tables using existing queries intended for
          tables containing only scalar columns. This technique also lets you use tables with complex types with BI tools that are not aware
          of the data types and query notation for accessing complex type columns.
        </p>




        <p class="p">
          For example, the variation of the TPC-H schema containing complex types has a table <code class="ph codeph">REGION</code>. This table has 5
          rows, corresponding to 5 regions such as <code class="ph codeph">NORTH AMERICA</code> and <code class="ph codeph">AFRICA</code>. Each row has an
          <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> column, where each array item is a <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> containing details about a country in that
          region.

          The same data could be represented in traditional denormalized form, as a single table where the information about each region is
          repeated over and over, alongside the information about each country. The nested complex types let us avoid the repetition, while
          still keeping the data in a single table rather than normalizing across multiple tables.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          To use this table with a JDBC or ODBC application that expected scalar columns, we could create a view that represented the result
          set as a set of scalar columns (three columns from the original table, plus three more from the <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> fields of
          the array elements). In the following examples, any column with an <code class="ph codeph">R_*</code> prefix is taken unchanged from the
          original table, while any column with an <code class="ph codeph">N_*</code> prefix is extracted from the <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> inside the

      <h3 class="title topictitle3" id="ariaid-title25">Flattening Normalized Tables into a Single Table with Complex Types</h3>


      <div class="body conbody">

        <p class="p">
          One common use for complex types is to embed the contents of one table into another. The traditional technique of denormalizing
          results in a huge number of rows with some column values repeated over and over. With complex types, you can keep the same number
          of rows as in the original normalized table, and put all the associated data from the other table in a single new column.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          In this flattening scenario, you might frequently use a column that is an <code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code> consisting of
          <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> elements, where each field within the <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code> corresponds to a column name from the table
          that you are combining.
        </p>


        <p class="p">
          The following example shows a traditional normalized layout using two tables, and then an equivalent layout using complex types in
          a single table.
        </p>

        <p class="p">

        <p class="p">
