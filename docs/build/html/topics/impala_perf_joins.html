  <h1 class="title topictitle1" id="ariaid-title1">Performance Considerations for Join Queries</h1>
  
  

  <div class="body conbody">

    <p class="p">
      Queries involving join operations often require more tuning than queries that refer to only one table. The
      maximum size of the result set from a join query is the product of the number of rows in all the joined
      tables. When joining several tables with millions or billions of rows, any missed opportunity to filter the
      result set, or other inefficiency in the query, could lead to an operation that does not finish in a
      practical time and has to be cancelled.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
      The simplest technique for tuning an Impala join query is to collect statistics on each table involved in the
      join using the <code class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="impala_compute_stats.html#compute_stats">COMPUTE STATS</a></code>
      statement, and then let Impala automatically optimize the query based on the size of each table, number of
      distinct values of each column, and so on. The <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE STATS</code> statement and the join
      optimization are new features introduced in Impala 1.2.2. For accurate statistics about each table, issue the
      <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE STATS</code> statement after loading the data into that table, and again if the amount of
      data changes substantially due to an <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code>, <code class="ph codeph">LOAD DATA</code>, adding a partition,
      and so on.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
      If statistics are not available for all the tables in the join query, or if Impala chooses a join order that
      is not the most efficient, you can override the automatic join order optimization by specifying the
      <code class="ph codeph">STRAIGHT_JOIN</code> keyword immediately after the <code class="ph codeph">SELECT</code> and any <code class="ph codeph">DISTINCT</code>
      or <code class="ph codeph">ALL</code> keywords. In this case, Impala uses the order the tables appear in the query to guide how the
      joins are processed.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
      When you use the <code class="ph codeph">STRAIGHT_JOIN</code> technique, you must order the tables in the join query
      manually instead of relying on the Impala optimizer. The optimizer uses sophisticated techniques to estimate
      the size of the result set at each stage of the join. For manual ordering, use this heuristic approach to
      start with, and then experiment to fine-tune the order:
    </p>

    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">
        Specify the largest table first. This table is read from disk by each Impala node and so its size is not
        significant in terms of memory usage during the query.
      </li>

      <li class="li">
        Next, specify the smallest table. The contents of the second, third, and so on tables are all transmitted
        across the network. You want to minimize the size of the result set from each subsequent stage of the join
        query. The most likely approach involves joining a small table first, so that the result set remains small
        even as subsequent larger tables are processed.
      </li>

      <li class="li">
        Join the next smallest table, then the next smallest, and so on.
      </li>

      <li class="li">
        For example, if you had tables <code class="ph codeph">BIG</code>, <code class="ph codeph">MEDIUM</code>, <code class="ph codeph">SMALL</code>, and
        <code class="ph codeph">TINY</code>, the logical join order to try would be <code class="ph codeph">BIG</code>, <code class="ph codeph">TINY</code>,
        <code class="ph codeph">SMALL</code>, <code class="ph codeph">MEDIUM</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="p">
      The terms <span class="q">"largest"</span> and <span class="q">"smallest"</span> refers to the size of the intermediate result set based on the
      number of rows and columns from each table that are part of the result set. For example, if you join one
      table <code class="ph codeph">sales</code> with another table <code class="ph codeph">customers</code>, a query might find results from
      100 different customers who made a total of 5000 purchases. In that case, you would specify <code class="ph codeph">SELECT
      ... FROM sales JOIN customers ...</code>, putting <code class="ph codeph">customers</code> on the right side because it
      is smaller in the context of this query.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
      The Impala query planner chooses between different techniques for performing join queries, depending on the
      absolute and relative sizes of the tables. <strong class="ph b">Broadcast joins</strong> are the default, where the right-hand table
      is considered to be smaller than the left-hand table, and its contents are sent to all the other nodes
      involved in the query. The alternative technique is known as a <strong class="ph b">partitioned join</strong> (not related to a
      partitioned table), which is more suitable for large tables of roughly equal size. With this technique,
      portions of each table are sent to appropriate other nodes where those subsets of rows can be processed in
      parallel. The choice of broadcast or partitioned join also depends on statistics being available for all
      tables in the join, gathered by the <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE STATS</code> statement.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
      To see which join strategy is used for a particular query, issue an <code class="ph codeph">EXPLAIN</code> statement for
      the query. If you find that a query uses a broadcast join when you know through benchmarking that a
      partitioned join would be more efficient, or vice versa, add a hint to the query to specify the precise join
      mechanism to use. See <a class="xref" href="impala_hints.html#hints">Query Hints in Impala SELECT Statements</a> for details.

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        If table or column statistics are not available for some tables in a join, Impala still reorders the tables
        using the information that is available. Tables with statistics are placed on the left side of the join
        order, in descending order of cost based on overall size and cardinality. Tables without statistics are
        treated as zero-size, that is, they are always placed on the right side of the join order.

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title3">Overriding Join Reordering with STRAIGHT_JOIN</h2>

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        If an Impala join query is inefficient because of outdated statistics or unexpected data distribution, you
        can keep Impala from reordering the joined tables by using the <code class="ph codeph">STRAIGHT_JOIN</code> keyword
        immediately after the <code class="ph codeph">SELECT</code> and any <code class="ph codeph">DISTINCT</code> or <code class="ph codeph">ALL</code>
        keywords. The <code class="ph codeph">STRAIGHT_JOIN</code> keyword turns off
        the reordering of join clauses that Impala does internally, and produces a plan that relies on the join
        clauses being ordered optimally in the query text. In this case, rewrite the query so that the largest
        table is on the left, followed by the next largest, and so on until the smallest table is on the right.
      </p>

      <div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title notetitle">Note:</span> 
        <p class="p">
        The <code class="ph codeph">STRAIGHT_JOIN</code> hint affects the join order of table references in the query
        block containing the hint. It does not affect the join order of nested queries, such as views,
        inline views, or <code class="ph codeph">WHERE</code>-clause subqueries. To use this hint for performance
        tuning of complex queries, apply the hint to all query blocks that need a fixed join order.
      </p>
      </div>

      <p class="p">
        In this example, the subselect from the <code class="ph codeph">BIG</code> table produces a very small result set, but
        the table might still be treated as if it were the biggest and placed first in the join order. Using
        <code class="ph codeph">STRAIGHT_JOIN</code> for the last join clause prevents the final table from being reordered,
        keeping it as the rightmost table in the join order.

      <div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title notetitle">Note:</span> 
        When examining the performance of join queries and the effectiveness of the join order optimization, make
        sure the query involves enough data and cluster resources to see a difference depending on the query plan.
        For example, a single data file of just a few megabytes will reside in a single HDFS block and be processed
        on a single node. Likewise, if you use a single-node or two-node cluster, there might not be much
        difference in efficiency for the broadcast or partitioned join strategies.
