    <p class="p">
      To monitor how Impala data is being used within your organization, ensure that your Impala
      authorization and authentication policies are effective. To detect attempts at intrusion
      or unauthorized access to Impala data, you can use the auditing feature in Impala 1.2.1
      and higher:
    </p>


    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">
        Enable auditing by including the option
        <code class="ph codeph">‑‑audit_event_log_dir=<var class="keyword varname">directory_path</var></code> in
        your <span class="keyword cmdname">impalad</span> startup options. The log directory must be a local
        directory on the server, not an HDFS directory.
      </li>


      <li class="li">
        Decide how many queries will be represented in each audit event log file. By default,
        Impala starts a new audit event log file every 5000 queries. To specify a different
        number, <span class="ph">include the option
        <code class="ph codeph">‑‑max_audit_event_log_file_size=<var class="keyword varname">number_of_queries</var></code>
        in the <span class="keyword cmdname">impalad</span> startup options</span>.
      </li>


      <li class="li">
        In <span class="keyword">Impala 2.9</span> and higher, you can control how many audit event
        log files are kept on each host. Specify the option
        <code class="ph codeph">‑‑max_audit_event_log_files=<var class="keyword varname">number_of_log_files</var></code>
        in the <span class="keyword cmdname">impalad</span> startup options. Once the limit is reached, older
        files are rotated out using the same mechanism as for other Impala log files. The
        default value for this setting is 0, representing an unlimited number of audit event log
        files.
      </li>


      <li class="li">
        Use a cluster manager with governance capabilities to filter, visualize, and produce
        reports based on the audit logs collected from all the hosts in the cluster.
      </li>

    </ul>

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title2">Durability and Performance Considerations for Impala Auditing</h2>


    

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        The auditing feature only imposes performance overhead while auditing is enabled.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        Because any Impala host can process a query, enable auditing on all hosts where the
        <span class="ph"><span class="keyword cmdname">impalad</span> daemon</span>
         runs. Each host stores its own log
        files, in a directory in the local filesystem. The log data is periodically flushed to
        disk (through an <code class="ph codeph">fsync()</code> system call) to avoid loss of audit data in
        case of a crash.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        The runtime overhead of auditing applies to whichever host serves as the coordinator for
        the query, that is, the host you connect to when you issue the query. This might be the
        same host for all queries, or different applications or users might connect to and issue
        queries through different hosts.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        To avoid excessive I/O overhead on busy coordinator hosts, Impala syncs the audit log
        data (using the <code class="ph codeph">fsync()</code> system call) periodically rather than after
        every query. Currently, the <code class="ph codeph">fsync()</code> calls are issued at a fixed
        interval, every 5 seconds.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        By default, Impala avoids losing any audit log data in the case of an error during a
        logging operation (such as a disk full error), by immediately shutting down
        <span class="keyword cmdname">impalad</span> on the host where the auditing problem occurred.
        <span class="ph">You can override this setting by specifying the
        option <code class="ph codeph">‑‑abort_on_failed_audit_event=false</code> in the
        <span class="keyword cmdname">impalad</span> startup options.</span>
      </p>

  <div class="topic concept nested1" aria-labelledby="ariaid-title3" id="auditing_format">

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title3">Format of the Audit Log Files</h2>


    

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        The audit log files represent the query information in JSON format, one query per line.
        Typically, rather than looking at the log files themselves, you should use
        cluster-management software to consolidate the log data from all Impala hosts and filter
        and visualize the results in useful ways. (If you do examine the raw log data, you might
        run the files through a JSON pretty-printer first.)
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        All the information about schema objects accessed by the query is encoded in a single
        nested record on the same line. For example, the audit log for an <code class="ph codeph">INSERT ...
        SELECT</code> statement records that a select operation occurs on the source table and
        an insert operation occurs on the destination table. The audit log for a query against a
        view records the base table accessed by the view, or multiple base tables in the case of
        a view that includes a join query. Every Impala operation that corresponds to a SQL
        statement is recorded in the audit logs, whether the operation succeeds or fails. Impala
        records more information for a successful operation than for a failed one, because an
        unauthorized query is stopped immediately, before all the query planning is completed.
      </p>




      <p class="p">
        The information logged for each query includes:

        The kinds of SQL queries represented in the audit log are:

      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">
          Queries that are prevented due to lack of authorization.

          Queries that Impala can analyze and parse to determine that they are authorized. The

      </ul>


      <p class="p">
        The audit log does not contain entries for queries that could not be parsed and
        analyzed. For example, a query that fails due to a syntax error is not recorded in the
        audit log. The audit log also does not contain queries that fail due to a reference to a
        table that does not exist, if you would be authorized to access the table if it did
        exist.
