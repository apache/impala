  <div class="body conbody">

    <p class="p">
      Impala makes use of many familiar components within the Hadoop ecosystem. Impala can interchange data with
      other Hadoop components, as both a consumer and a producer, so it can fit in flexible ways into your ETL and
      ELT pipelines.

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title2">How Impala Works with Hive</h2>


    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        A major Impala goal is to make SQL-on-Hadoop operations fast and efficient enough to appeal to new
        categories of users and open up Hadoop to new types of use cases. Where practical, it makes use of existing
        Apache Hive infrastructure that many Hadoop users already have in place to perform long-running,
        batch-oriented SQL queries.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        In particular, Impala keeps its table definitions in a traditional MySQL or PostgreSQL database known as
        the <strong class="ph b">metastore</strong>, the same database where Hive keeps this type of data. Thus, Impala can access tables
        defined or loaded by Hive, as long as all columns use Impala-supported data types, file formats, and
        compression codecs.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        The initial focus on query features and performance means that Impala can read more types of data with the
        <code class="ph codeph">SELECT</code> statement than it can write with the <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code> statement. To query
        data using the Avro, RCFile, or SequenceFile <a class="xref" href="impala_file_formats.html#file_formats">file
        formats</a>, you load the data using Hive.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        The Impala query optimizer can also make use of <a class="xref" href="impala_perf_stats.html#perf_table_stats">table
        statistics</a> and <a class="xref" href="impala_perf_stats.html#perf_column_stats">column statistics</a>.
        Originally, you gathered this information with the <code class="ph codeph">ANALYZE TABLE</code> statement in Hive; in
        Impala 1.2.2 and higher, use the Impala <code class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="impala_compute_stats.html#compute_stats">COMPUTE
        STATS</a></code> statement instead. <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE STATS</code> requires less setup, is more
        reliable, and does not require switching back and forth between <span class="keyword cmdname">impala-shell</span>
        and the Hive shell.

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title3">Overview of Impala Metadata and the Metastore</h2>

  

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        As discussed in <a class="xref" href="impala_hadoop.html#intro_hive">How Impala Works with Hive</a>, Impala maintains information about table
        definitions in a central database known as the <strong class="ph b">metastore</strong>. Impala also tracks other metadata for the
        low-level characteristics of data files:
      </p>


      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">
          The physical locations of blocks within HDFS.
        </li>

      </ul>


      <p class="p">
        For tables with a large volume of data and/or many partitions, retrieving all the metadata for a table can
        be time-consuming, taking minutes in some cases. Thus, each Impala node caches all of this metadata to
        reuse for future queries against the same table.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        If the table definition or the data in the table is updated, all other Impala daemons in the cluster must
        receive the latest metadata, replacing the obsolete cached metadata, before issuing a query against that
        table. In Impala 1.2 and higher, the metadata update is automatic, coordinated through the
        <span class="keyword cmdname">catalogd</span> daemon, for all DDL and DML statements issued through Impala. See
        <a class="xref" href="impala_components.html#intro_catalogd">The Impala Catalog Service</a> for details.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        For DDL and DML issued through Hive, or changes made manually to files in HDFS, you still use the
        <code class="ph codeph">REFRESH</code> statement (when new data files are added to existing tables) or the
        <code class="ph codeph">INVALIDATE METADATA</code> statement (for entirely new tables, or after dropping a table,
        performing an HDFS rebalance operation, or deleting data files). Issuing <code class="ph codeph">INVALIDATE
        METADATA</code> by itself retrieves metadata for all the tables tracked by the metastore. If you know
        that only specific tables have been changed outside of Impala, you can issue <code class="ph codeph">REFRESH
        <var class="keyword varname">table_name</var></code> for each affected table to only retrieve the latest metadata for
        those tables.

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title4">How Impala Uses HDFS</h2>

  

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        Impala uses the distributed filesystem HDFS as its primary data storage medium. Impala relies on the
        redundancy provided by HDFS to guard against hardware or network outages on individual nodes. Impala table
        data is physically represented as data files in HDFS, using familiar HDFS file formats and compression
        codecs. When data files are present in the directory for a new table, Impala reads them all, regardless of
        file name. New data is added in files with names controlled by Impala.

  <div class="topic concept nested1" aria-labelledby="ariaid-title5" id="intro_hbase">

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title5">How Impala Uses HBase</h2>

  

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        HBase is an alternative to HDFS as a storage medium for Impala data. It is a database storage system built
        on top of HDFS, without built-in SQL support. Many Hadoop users already have it configured and store large
        (often sparse) data sets in it. By defining tables in Impala and mapping them to equivalent tables in
        HBase, you can query the contents of the HBase tables through Impala, and even perform join queries
        including both Impala and HBase tables. See <a class="xref" href="impala_hbase.html#impala_hbase">Using Impala to Query HBase Tables</a> for details.
