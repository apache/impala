      By default, all the data files for a table are located in a single directory. Partitioning is a technique for physically dividing the
      data during loading, based on values from one or more columns, to speed up queries that test those columns. For example, with a
      <code class="ph codeph">school_records</code> table partitioned on a <code class="ph codeph">year</code> column, there is a separate data directory for each
      different year value, and all the data for that year is stored in a data file in that directory. A query that includes a
      <code class="ph codeph">WHERE</code> condition such as <code class="ph codeph">YEAR=1966</code>, <code class="ph codeph">YEAR IN (1989,1999)</code>, or <code class="ph codeph">YEAR BETWEEN
      1984 AND 1989</code> can examine only the data files from the appropriate directory or directories, greatly reducing the amount of
      data to read and test.

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title2">When to Use Partitioned Tables</h2>


    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        Partitioning is typically appropriate for:
      </p>


      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">
          Tables that are very large, where reading the entire data set takes an impractical amount of time.
        </li>


        <li class="li">
          Tables that are always or almost always queried with conditions on the partitioning columns. In our example of a table partitioned
          by year, <code class="ph codeph">SELECT COUNT(*) FROM school_records WHERE year = 1985</code> is efficient, only examining a small fraction of
          the data; but <code class="ph codeph">SELECT COUNT(*) FROM school_records</code> has to process a separate data file for each year, resulting in
          more overall work than in an unpartitioned table. You would probably not partition this way if you frequently queried the table
          based on last name, student ID, and so on without testing the year.
        </li>


        <li class="li">
          Columns that have reasonable cardinality (number of different values). If a column only has a small number of values, for example
          <code class="ph codeph">Male</code> or <code class="ph codeph">Female</code>, you do not gain much efficiency by eliminating only about 50% of the data to
          read for each query. If a column has only a few rows matching each value, the number of directories to process can become a
          limiting factor, and the data file in each directory could be too small to take advantage of the Hadoop mechanism for transmitting
          data in multi-megabyte blocks. For example, you might partition census data by year, store sales data by year and month, and web
          traffic data by year, month, and day. (Some users with high volumes of incoming data might even partition down to the individual
          hour and minute.)
        </li>


        <li class="li">
          Data that already passes through an extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipeline. The values of the partitioning columns are
          stripped from the original data files and represented by directory names, so loading data into a partitioned table involves some
          sort of transformation or preprocessing.
        </li>

      </ul>

        <li class="li">
          In <span class="keyword">Impala 2.5</span> and higher, you can also use the <code class="ph codeph">PARTITIONED BY</code> clause in a <code class="ph codeph">CREATE TABLE AS

        If you are creating a partition for the first time and specifying its location, for

          When you insert data into a partitioned table, you identify the

          not stored in data files, but instead determine the directory where
          that row value is stored. You can also specify which partition to load
          a set of data into, with <code class="ph codeph">INSERT OVERWRITE</code> statements;
          you can replace the contents of a specific partition but you cannot
          append data to a specific partition. <p class="p">
        By default, if an <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code> statement creates any new subdirectories

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        Specifying all the partition columns in a SQL statement is called <dfn class="term">static partitioning</dfn>, because the statement affects a
        single predictable partition. For example, you use static partitioning with an <code class="ph codeph">ALTER TABLE</code> statement that affects
        only one partition, or with an <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code> statement that inserts all values into the same partition:
      </p>


<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>insert into t1 <strong class="ph b">partition(x=10, y='a')</strong> select c1 from some_other_table;
</code></pre>

      <p class="p">
        When you specify some partition key columns in an <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code> statement, but leave out the values, Impala determines
        which partition to insert. This technique is called <dfn class="term">dynamic partitioning</dfn>:
      </p>


<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>insert into t1 <strong class="ph b">partition(x, y='b')</strong> select c1, c2 from some_other_table;

-- Create new partition if necessary for specified year and month but variable day; insert a single value.

      <p class="p">
        The more key columns you specify in the <code class="ph codeph">PARTITION</code> clause, the fewer columns you need in the <code class="ph codeph">SELECT</code>
        list. The trailing columns in the <code class="ph codeph">SELECT</code> list are substituted in order for the partition key columns with no
        specified value.

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        The <code class="ph codeph">REFRESH</code> statement is typically used with partitioned tables when new data files are loaded into a partition by
        some non-Impala mechanism, such as a Hive or Spark job. The <code class="ph codeph">REFRESH</code> statement makes Impala aware of the new data
        files so that they can be used in Impala queries. Because partitioned tables typically contain a high volume of data, the
        <code class="ph codeph">REFRESH</code> operation for a full partitioned table can take significant time.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        In <span class="keyword">Impala 2.7</span> and higher, you can include a <code class="ph codeph">PARTITION (<var class="keyword varname">partition_spec</var>)</code> clause in the

        Partition pruning refers to the mechanism where a query can skip reading the data files corresponding to one or more partitions. If

        resources and are thus proportionally faster and more scalable.

        <p class="p">
          
          Impala can even do partition pruning in cases where the partition key column is not directly compared to a constant, by applying

          is available in Impala 1.2.2 and later. In this example, the census table includes another column indicating when the data was
          collected, which happens in 10-year intervals. Even though the query does not compare the partition key column
          (<code class="ph codeph">YEAR</code>) to a constant value, Impala can deduce that only the partition <code class="ph codeph">YEAR=2010</code> is required, and

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        Partitioned tables have the flexibility to use different file formats for different partitions. (For background information about
        the different file formats Impala supports, see <a class="xref" href="impala_file_formats.html#file_formats">How Impala Works with Hadoop File Formats</a>.) For example, if you originally
        received data in text format, then received new data in RCFile format, and eventually began receiving data in Parquet format, all
        that data could reside in the same table for queries. You just need to ensure that the table is structured so that the data files
        that use different file formats reside in separate partitions.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        For example, here is how you might switch from text to Parquet data as you receive data for different years:
      </p>


<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>[localhost:21000] &gt; create table census (name string) partitioned by (year smallint);
[localhost:21000] &gt; alter table census add partition (year=2012); -- Text format;

[localhost:21000] &gt; alter table census add partition (year=2013); -- Text format switches to Parquet before data loaded;
[localhost:21000] &gt; alter table census partition (year=2013) set fileformat parquet;

[localhost:21000] &gt; insert into census partition (year=2012) values ('Smith'),('Jones'),('Lee'),('Singh');
[localhost:21000] &gt; insert into census partition (year=2013) values ('Flores'),('Bogomolov'),('Cooper'),('Appiah');</code></pre>

      <p class="p">
        At this point, the HDFS directory for <code class="ph codeph">year=2012</code> contains a text-format data file, while the HDFS directory for
        <code class="ph codeph">year=2013</code> contains a Parquet data file. As always, when loading non-trivial data, you would use <code class="ph codeph">INSERT ...
        SELECT</code> or <code class="ph codeph">LOAD DATA</code> to import data in large batches, rather than <code class="ph codeph">INSERT ... VALUES</code> which
        produces small files that are inefficient for real-world queries.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        For other file types that Impala cannot create natively, you can switch into Hive and issue the <code class="ph codeph">ALTER TABLE ... SET
        FILEFORMAT</code> statements and <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code> or <code class="ph codeph">LOAD DATA</code> statements there. After switching back to
        Impala, issue a <code class="ph codeph">REFRESH <var class="keyword varname">table_name</var></code> statement so that Impala recognizes any partitions or new
        data added through Hive.

      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
        If you are creating a partition for the first time and specifying its location, for
        maximum efficiency, use a single <code class="ph codeph">ALTER TABLE</code> statement including both
        the <code class="ph codeph">ADD PARTITION</code> and <code class="ph codeph">LOCATION</code> clauses, rather than
        separate statements with <code class="ph codeph">ADD PARTITION</code> and <code class="ph codeph">SET
        LOCATION</code> clauses.
      </div>


      <p class="p">
        What happens to the data files when a partition is dropped depends on whether the partitioned table is designated as internal or
        external. For an internal (managed) table, the data files are deleted. For example, if data in the partitioned table is a copy of
        raw data files stored elsewhere, you might save disk space by dropping older partitions that are no longer required for reporting,
        knowing that the original data is still available if needed later. For an external table, the data files are left alone. For
        example, dropping a partition without deleting the associated files lets Impala consider a smaller set of partitions, improving
        query efficiency and reducing overhead for DDL operations on the table; if the data is needed again later, you can add the partition
        again. See <a class="xref" href="impala_tables.html#tables">Overview of Impala Tables</a> for details and examples.

      <p class="p">
        Because the <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE STATS</code> statement can be resource-intensive to run on a partitioned table
        as new partitions are added, Impala includes a variation of this statement that allows computing statistics
        on a per-partition basis such that stats can be incrementally updated when new partitions are added.
      </p>


      <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span>

        For a particular table, use either <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE STATS</code> or <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE

        switch from <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE STATS</code> to <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS</code>
        during the lifetime of a table, or vice versa, drop all statistics by running
        <code class="ph codeph">DROP STATS</code> before making the switch.
      </p>

        <p class="p">
        When you run <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS</code> on a table for the first time,
        the statistics are computed again from scratch regardless of whether the table already
        has statistics. Therefore, expect a one-time resource-intensive operation for scanning
        the entire table when running <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS</code> for the first
        time on a given table.
      </p>

        <p class="p">
        In Impala 3.0 and lower, approximately 400 bytes of metadata per column per partition
        are needed for caching. Tables with a big number of partitions and many columns can add
        up to a significant memory overhead as the metadata must be cached on the
        <span class="keyword cmdname">catalogd</span> host and on every <span class="keyword cmdname">impalad</span> host that is
        eligible to be a coordinator. If this metadata for all tables exceeds 2 GB, you might
        experience service downtime. In Impala 3.1 and higher, the issue was alleviated with an
        improved handling of incremental stats.
      </p>

      </div>


      <p class="p">
        The <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS</code> variation computes statistics only for partitions that were
        added or changed since the last <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS</code> statement, rather than the entire
