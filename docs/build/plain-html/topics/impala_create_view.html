    <p class="p">
      The <code class="ph codeph">CREATE VIEW</code> statement lets you create a shorthand abbreviation for a
      more complicated query. The base query can involve joins, expressions, reordered columns,
      column aliases, and other SQL features that can make a query hard to understand or
      maintain.
    </p>


    <p class="p">
      Because a view is purely a logical construct (an alias for a query) with no physical data
      behind it, <code class="ph codeph">ALTER VIEW</code> only involves changes to metadata in the metastore
      database, not any data files in HDFS.
    </p>


    <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">Syntax:</strong>
      </p>


<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>CREATE VIEW [IF NOT EXISTS] <var class="keyword varname">view_name</var>
    [(<var class="keyword varname">column_name</var> [COMMENT '<var class="keyword varname">column_comment</var>'][, ...])]
    [COMMENT '<var class="keyword varname">view_comment</var>']
    [TBLPROPERTIES ('<var class="keyword varname">name</var>' = '<var class="keyword varname">value</var>'[, ...])]
  AS <var class="keyword varname">select_statement</var></code></pre>

    <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">Statement type:</strong> DDL
      </p>


    <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">Usage notes:</strong>
      </p>


    <p class="p">
      The <code class="ph codeph">CREATE VIEW</code> statement can be useful in scenarios such as the
      following:
    </p>


    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">
        To turn even the most lengthy and complicated SQL query into a one-liner. You can issue
        simple queries against the view from applications, scripts, or interactive queries in
        <span class="keyword cmdname">impala-shell</span>. For example:
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>select * from <var class="keyword varname">view_name</var>;
select * from <var class="keyword varname">view_name</var> order by c1 desc limit 10;</code></pre>
        The more complicated and hard-to-read the original query, the more benefit there is to
        simplifying the query using a view.
      </li>


      <li class="li">
        To hide the underlying table and column names, to minimize maintenance problems if those
        names change. In that case, you re-create the view using the new names, and all queries
        that use the view rather than the underlying tables keep running with no changes.
      </li>


      <li class="li">
        To experiment with optimization techniques and make the optimized queries available to
        all applications. For example, if you find a combination of <code class="ph codeph">WHERE</code>
        conditions, join order, join hints, and so on that works the best for a class of
        queries, you can establish a view that incorporates the best-performing techniques.
        Applications can then make relatively simple queries against the view, without repeating
        the complicated and optimized logic over and over. If you later find a better way to
        optimize the original query, when you re-create the view, all the applications
        immediately take advantage of the optimized base query.
      </li>


      <li class="li">
        To simplify a whole class of related queries, especially complicated queries involving
        joins between multiple tables, complicated expressions in the column list, and other SQL
        syntax that makes the query difficult to understand and debug. For example, you might
        create a view that joins several tables, filters using several <code class="ph codeph">WHERE</code>
        conditions, and selects several columns from the result set. Applications might issue
        queries against this view that only vary in their <code class="ph codeph">LIMIT</code>, <code class="ph codeph">ORDER
        BY</code>, and similar simple clauses.
      </li>

    </ul>


    <p class="p">
      For queries that require repeating complicated clauses over and over again, for example in
      the select list, <code class="ph codeph">ORDER BY</code>, and <code class="ph codeph">GROUP BY</code> clauses, you can
      use the <code class="ph codeph">WITH</code> clause as an alternative to creating a view.
    </p>


    <p class="p">
      You can optionally specify the table-level and the column-level comments as in the
      <code class="ph codeph">CREATE TABLE</code> statement.
    </p>


    <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">Complex type considerations:</strong>
      </p>


    <p class="p">
        For tables containing complex type columns (<code class="ph codeph">ARRAY</code>,
        <code class="ph codeph">STRUCT</code>, or <code class="ph codeph">MAP</code>), you typically use join queries to
        refer to the complex values. You can use views to hide the join notation, making such
        tables seem like traditional denormalized tables, and making those tables queryable by
        business intelligence tools that do not have built-in support for those complex types.
        See <a class="xref" href="../shared/../topics/impala_complex_types.html#complex_types_views">Accessing Complex Type Data in Flattened Form Using Views</a> for details.
      </p>


    <p class="p">
        Because you cannot directly issue <code class="ph codeph">SELECT <var class="keyword varname">col_name</var></code>
        against a column of complex type, you cannot use a view or a <code class="ph codeph">WITH</code>
        clause to <span class="q">"rename"</span> a column by selecting it with a column alias.
      </p>


    <p class="p">
        If you connect to different Impala nodes within an <span class="keyword cmdname">impala-shell</span>
        session for load-balancing purposes, you can enable the <code class="ph codeph">SYNC_DDL</code> query
        option to make each DDL statement wait before returning, until the new or changed
        metadata has been received by all the Impala nodes. See
        <a class="xref" href="../shared/../topics/impala_sync_ddl.html#sync_ddl">SYNC_DDL Query Option</a> for details.
      </p>


    <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">Security considerations:</strong>
      </p>


    <p class="p">
        If these statements in your environment contain sensitive literal values such as credit
        card numbers or tax identifiers, Impala can redact this sensitive information when
        displaying the statements in log files and other administrative contexts. See
        <span class="xref">the documentation for your Apache Hadoop distribution</span> for details.
      </p>


    <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">Cancellation:</strong> Cannot be cancelled.
      </p>


    <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">HDFS permissions:</strong> This statement does not touch any HDFS files or directories,
        therefore no HDFS permissions are required.
      </p>


    <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">Examples:</strong>
      </p>
