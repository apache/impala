    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title2">The Impala Daemon</h2>


    <div class="body conbody">

      <div class="p"> The core Impala component is the Impala daemon, physically represented by the
          <code class="ph codeph">impalad</code> process. A few of the key functions that an Impala daemon
        performs are:<ul class="ul">
          <li class="li">Reads and writes to data files.</li>

          <li class="li">Accepts queries transmitted from the <code class="ph codeph">impala-shell</code> command, Hue, JDBC,
            or ODBC.</li>

          <li class="li">Parallelizes the queries and distributes work across the cluster.</li>

          <li class="li">Transmits intermediate query results back to the central coordinator. </li>

        </ul>
</div>

      <div class="p">Impala daemons can be deployed in one of the following ways:<ul class="ul">
          <li class="li">HDFS and Impala are co-located, and each Impala daemon runs on the same host as a
            DataNode.</li>

          <li class="li">Impala is deployed separately in a compute cluster and reads remotely from HDFS, S3,
            ADLS, etc.</li>

        </ul>
</div>


      <p class="p"> The Impala daemons are in constant communication with StateStore, to confirm which daemons
        are healthy and can accept new work. </p>


      <p class="p"> They also receive broadcast messages from the <span class="keyword cmdname">catalogd</span> daemon
        (introduced in Impala 1.2) whenever any Impala daemon in the cluster creates, alters, or
        drops any type of object, or when an <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code> or <code class="ph codeph">LOAD DATA</code>
        statement is processed through Impala. This background communication minimizes the need for
          <code class="ph codeph">REFRESH</code> or <code class="ph codeph">INVALIDATE METADATA</code> statements that were
        needed to coordinate metadata across Impala daemons prior to Impala 1.2. </p>


      <p class="p"> In <span class="keyword">Impala 2.9</span> and
        higher, you can control which hosts act as query coordinators and which act as query
        executors, to improve scalability for highly concurrent workloads on large clusters. See
          <a class="xref" href="impala_dedicated_coordinator.html">How to Configure Impala with Dedicated Coordinators</a> for details. </p>


      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Impala daemons should be deployed on nodes using the same Glibc version since different
        Glibc version supports different Unicode standard version and also ensure that the
        en_US.UTF-8 locale is installed in the nodes. Not using the same Glibc version might result
        in inconsistent UTF-8 behavior when UTF8_MODE is set to true.</div>

  <div class="topic concept nested1" aria-labelledby="ariaid-title3" id="intro_statestore">

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title3">The Impala Statestore</h2>


    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p"> The Impala component known as the StateStore checks on the health of
        all Impala daemons in a cluster, and continuously relays its findings to
        each of those daemons. It is physically represented by a daemon process
        named <code class="ph codeph">statestored</code>. You only need such a process on one
        host in a cluster. If an Impala daemon goes offline due to hardware
        failure, network error, software issue, or other reason, the StateStore
        informs all the other Impala daemons so that future queries can avoid
        making requests to the unreachable Impala daemon. </p>


      <p class="p"> Because the StateStore's purpose is to help when things go wrong and
        to broadcast metadata to coordinators, it is not always critical to the
        normal operation of an Impala cluster. If the StateStore is not running
        or becomes unreachable, the Impala daemons continue running and
        distributing work among themselves as usual when working with the data
        known to Impala. The cluster just becomes less robust if other Impala
        daemons fail, and metadata becomes less consistent as it changes while
        the StateStore is offline. When the StateStore comes back online, it
        re-establishes communication with the Impala daemons and resumes its
        monitoring and broadcasting functions. </p>


      <p class="p"> If you issue a DDL statement while the StateStore is down, the queries
        that access the new object the DDL created will fail. </p>


      <p class="p">
        Most considerations for load balancing and high availability apply to the
        <span class="keyword cmdname">impalad</span> daemon. The <span class="keyword cmdname">statestored</span> and
        <span class="keyword cmdname">catalogd</span> daemons do not have special requirements for high
        availability, because problems with those daemons do not result in data loss. If those
        daemons become unavailable due to an outage on a particular host, you can stop the
        Impala service, delete the <span class="ph uicontrol">Impala StateStore</span> and
        <span class="ph uicontrol">Impala Catalog Server</span> roles, add the roles on a different host,
        and restart the Impala service.

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title4">The Impala Catalog Service</h2>


    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p"> The Impala component known as the Catalog Service relays the metadata changes from Impala
        SQL statements to all the Impala coordinators in a cluster. It is physically represented by
        a daemon process named <code class="ph codeph">catalogd</code>. You only need such a process on one host
        in a cluster. Because the requests are passed through the StateStore daemon, it makes sense
        to run the <span class="keyword cmdname">statestored</span> and <span class="keyword cmdname">catalogd</span> services on the
        same host. </p>


      <p class="p"> The catalog service avoids the need to issue <code class="ph codeph">REFRESH</code> and
          <code class="ph codeph">INVALIDATE METADATA</code> statements when the metadata changes are performed by
        statements issued through Impala.
      </p>
 
      <div class="p"> When you create a table, load data, and so on through Hive, you do need to issue
          <code class="ph codeph">REFRESH</code> or <code class="ph codeph">INVALIDATE METADATA</code> on an Impala daemon
        before executing a query. Performing <code class="ph codeph">REFRESH</code> or <code class="ph codeph">INVALIDATE
          METADATA</code> is not required when <cite class="cite">Automatic Invalidation/Refresh of
          Metadata</cite> is enabled. See <a class="xref" href="impala_metadata.html#impala_metadata">Automatic
          Invalidation/Refresh of Metadata</a> also known as the Hive Metastore (HMS) event

        <li class="li">
          <p class="p"> The <code class="ph codeph">REFRESH</code> and <code class="ph codeph">INVALIDATE
              METADATA</code> statements are not needed when the
              <code class="ph codeph">CREATE TABLE</code>, <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code>, or other
            table-changing or data-changing operation is performed through
            Impala. These statements are still needed if such operations are
            done through Hive or by manipulating data files directly in HDFS,
            but in those cases the statements only need to be issued on one
            Impala daemon rather than on all daemons. See <a class="xref" href="impala_refresh.html#refresh">REFRESH Statement</a> and <a class="xref" href="impala_invalidate_metadata.html#invalidate_metadata">INVALIDATE METADATA Statement</a> for
            the latest usage information for those statements. </p>

      <div class="p">
        Use <code class="ph codeph">‑‑load_catalog_in_background</code> option to control when the
        metadata of a table is loaded.
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li">
            If set to <code class="ph codeph">false</code>, the metadata of a table is loaded when it is
            referenced for the first time. This means that the first run of a particular query
            can be slower than subsequent runs. Starting in Impala 2.2, the default for
            <code class="ph codeph">‑‑load_catalog_in_background</code> is <code class="ph codeph">false</code>.
          </li>


          <li class="li">
            If set to <code class="ph codeph">true</code>, the catalog service attempts to load metadata for a
            table even if no query needed that metadata. So metadata will possibly be already
            loaded when the first query that would need it is run. However, for the following
            reasons, we recommend not to set the option to <code class="ph codeph">true</code>.
            <ul class="ul">
              <li class="li">
                Background load can interfere with query-specific metadata loading. This can
                happen on startup or after invalidating metadata, with a duration depending on
                the amount of metadata, and can lead to a seemingly random long running queries
                that are difficult to diagnose.
              </li>


              <li class="li">
                Impala may load metadata for tables that are possibly never used, potentially
                increasing catalog size and consequently memory usage for both catalog service
                and Impala Daemon.
