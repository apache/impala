    <p class="p"> The Impala logs record information about: </p>


    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li"> Any errors Impala encountered. If Impala experienced a serious error during startup, you
        must diagnose and troubleshoot that problem before you can do anything further with Impala. </li>


      <li class="li"> How Impala is configured. </li>


      <li class="li"> Jobs Impala has completed. </li>

    </ul>


    <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
      <p class="p"> Formerly, the logs contained the query profile for each query, showing low-level details
        of how the work is distributed among nodes and how intermediate and final results are
        transmitted across the network. To save space, those query profiles are now stored in
        zlib-compressed files in <span class="ph filepath">/var/log/impala/profiles</span>. You can access them
        through the Impala web user interface. For example, at
            <code class="ph codeph">http://<var class="keyword varname">impalad-node-hostname</var>:25000/queries</code>, each
        query is followed by a <code class="ph codeph">Profile</code> link leading to a page showing extensive
        analytical data for the query execution. </p>

      <p class="p"> The auditing feature introduced in Impala 1.1.1 produces a separate set of
        audit log files when enabled. See <a class="xref" href="impala_auditing.html#auditing">Auditing Impala Operations</a> for details. </p>

      <p class="p"> In <span class="keyword">Impala 2.9</span> and higher, you can control
        how many audit event log files are kept on each host through the
          <code class="ph codeph">‑‑max_audit_event_log_files</code> startup option for the
          <span class="keyword cmdname">impalad</span> daemon, similar to the
          <code class="ph codeph">‑‑max_log_files</code> option for regular log files. </p>

      <p class="p"> The lineage feature introduced in Impala 2.2.0 produces a separate lineage log
        file when enabled. See <a class="xref" href="impala_lineage.html#lineage">Viewing Lineage Information for Impala Data</a> for details. </p>

          outputs an important messages such as a warning or an error, but less important messages
          such as informational ones are buffered in memory rather than being flushed to disk
          immediately. </li>

      <p class="p"> Impala periodically switches the physical files representing the current log files, after
        which it is safe to remove the old files if they are no longer needed. </p>


      <p class="p"> Impala can automatically remove older unneeded log files, a feature known as <dfn class="term">log

      <div class="p"> In Impala 2.2 and higher, the <code class="ph codeph">‑‑max_log_files</code> configuration

          <code class="ph codeph">WARNING</code>, <code class="ph codeph">ERROR</code>, and <code class="ph codeph">FATAL</code>). You can

        the <code class="ph codeph">‑‑logbufsecs</code> setting, every 5 seconds by default. </p>


      <p class="p"> For some log levels, Impala logs are first temporarily buffered in memory and only written
        to disk periodically. The <code class="ph codeph">‑‑logbufsecs</code> setting controls the
        maximum time that log messages are buffered for. For example, with the default value of 5
        seconds, there may be up to a 5 second delay before a logged message shows up in the log
        file. </p>


      <p class="p"> It is not recommended that you set <code class="ph codeph">‑‑logbufsecs</code> to 0 as the
        setting makes the Impala daemon to spin in the thread that tries to delete old log files. </p>

      <p class="p">For debugging purposes you may be adjusting the logging configuration for Catalog and
        impalad servers. This required restarting the services. Impala supports adjusting the log
        levels dynamically without the need to restart the server. There is a

          <code class="ph codeph">log4j</code> log level of <code class="ph codeph">root</code> or
          <code class="ph codeph">org.apache.impala</code> by using the <code class="ph codeph">Get Java Log Level</code>
        button. Also you can change the <code class="ph codeph">vlog/log4j</code> levels to any supported levels
        of logging. You can select the log level using the <code class="ph codeph">LOG LEVEL</code> drop down box.
        You also have an option to restore the log levels to their original configuration by using
        the <code class="ph codeph">RESET</code> button.</p>

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title7">Setting Logging Levels</h2>


    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p"> Impala uses the GLOG system, which supports three logging levels. You can adjust logging
        levels by exporting variable settings. To change logging settings manually, use a command
        similar to the following on each node before starting <code class="ph codeph">impalad</code>: </p>


      <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>export GLOG_v=1</code></pre>

      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  For performance reasons, do not enable the most verbose logging level of 3 unless there
        is no other alternative for troubleshooting. </div>


      <p class="p"> For more information on how to configure GLOG, including how to set variable logging
        levels for different system components, see <a class="xref" href="https://github.com/google/glog" target="_blank">documentation for the
          glog project on github</a>. </p>


      <div class="section" id="log_levels__loglevels_details"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Understanding What is Logged at Different Logging Levels</h3>
        
        <p class="p"> As logging levels increase, the categories of information logged are cumulative. For
          example, GLOG_v=2 records everything GLOG_v=1 records, as well as additional information. </p>

        <p class="p"> Increasing logging levels imposes performance overhead and increases log size. Where
          practical, use GLOG_v=1 for most cases: this level has minimal performance impact but
          still captures useful troubleshooting information. </p>

        <p class="p"> Additional information logged at each level is as follows: </p>

        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li"> GLOG_v=1 - The default level. Logs information about each connection and query that
            is initiated to an <code class="ph codeph">impalad</code> instance, including runtime profiles. </li>


          <li class="li"> GLOG_v=2 - Everything from the previous level plus information for each RPC
            initiated. This level also records query execution progress information, including
            details on each file that is read. </li>


          <li class="li"> GLOG_v=3 - Everything from the previous level plus logging of every row that is read.
            This level is only applicable for the most serious troubleshooting and tuning scenarios,
            because it can produce exceptionally large and detailed log files, potentially leading
            to its own set of performance and capacity problems. </li>

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title8">Redacting Sensitive Information from Impala Log Files</h2>


    

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        <dfn class="term">Log redaction</dfn> is a security feature that prevents sensitive information from
        being displayed in locations used by administrators for monitoring and troubleshooting, such
        as log files and the Impala debug web user interface. You configure regular expressions that
        match sensitive types of information processed by your system, such as credit card numbers
        or tax IDs, and literals matching these patterns are obfuscated wherever they would normally
        be recorded in log files or displayed in administration or debugging user interfaces. </p>


      <p class="p"> In a security context, the log redaction feature is complementary to the Ranger
        authorization framework. Ranger prevents unauthorized users from being able to directly
        access table data. Redaction prevents administrators or support personnel from seeing the
        smaller amounts of sensitive or personally identifying information (PII) that might appear
        in queries issued by those authorized users. </p>


      <p class="p"> See <span class="xref">the documentation for your Apache Hadoop distribution</span> for details about how to enable this feature and set up
        the regular expressions to detect and redact sensitive information within SQL statement
