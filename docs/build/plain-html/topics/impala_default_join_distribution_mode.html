    <p class="p">
      
      This option determines the join distribution that Impala uses when any of the tables
      involved in a join query is missing statistics.
    </p>


    <p class="p">
      Impala optimizes join queries based on the presence of table statistics,
      which are produced by the Impala <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE STATS</code> statement.
      By default, when a table involved in the join query does not have statistics,
      Impala uses the <span class="q">"broadcast"</span> technique that transmits the entire contents
      of the table to all executor nodes participating in the query. If one table
      involved in a join has statistics and the other does not, the table without
      statistics is broadcast. If both tables are missing statistics, the table
      that is referenced second in the join order is broadcast. This behavior
      is appropriate when the table involved is relatively small, but can lead to
      excessive network, memory, and CPU overhead if the table being broadcast is
      large.
    </p>


    <p class="p">
      Because Impala queries frequently involve very large tables, and suboptimal
      joins for such tables could result in spilling or out-of-memory errors,
      the setting <code class="ph codeph">DEFAULT_JOIN_DISTRIBUTION_MODE=SHUFFLE</code> lets you
      override the default behavior. The shuffle join mechanism divides the corresponding rows
      of each table involved in a join query using a hashing algorithm, and transmits
      subsets of the rows to other nodes for processing. Typically, this kind of join is
      more efficient for joins between large tables of similar size.
    </p>


    <p class="p">
      The setting <code class="ph codeph">DEFAULT_JOIN_DISTRIBUTION_MODE=SHUFFLE</code> is
      recommended when setting up and deploying new clusters, because it is less likely
      to result in serious consequences such as spilling or out-of-memory errors if
      the query plan is based on incomplete information. This setting is not the default,
      to avoid changing the performance characteristics of join queries for clusters that
      are already tuned for their existing workloads.
    </p>


    <p class="p">
        <strong class="ph b">Type:</strong> integer
      </p>

    <p class="p">
      The allowed values are <code class="ph codeph">BROADCAST</code> (equivalent to 0)
      or <code class="ph codeph">SHUFFLE</code> (equivalent to 1).
    </p>
