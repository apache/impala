  <p class="p">
   This query option <code class="ph codeph">DELETE_STATS_IN_TRUNCATE</code> can be used to delete or retain
   table statistics. The default value of this option is 1 or true which means table statistics will
   be deleted as part of truncate operation. However the default may not be an ideal solution in
   case of non-transactional tables when the table and column statistics for the table are also
   deleted by default. This can be an expensive operation especially when many truncate table
   commands are running concurrently. In cases where truncate operation is used to remove the
   existing data and then reload new data, it is likely that you will compute stats again as soon as
   the new data is reloaded. This would overwrite the existing statistics and hence the additional
   time spent by the truncate operation to delete column and table statistics becomes obsolete. To
   avoid this expensive operation and to improve performance, you can set this query option to false
   or 0. When set to false, a truncate operation will not delete the table and column statistics for
   the table.
