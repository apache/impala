  <h1 class="title topictitle1" id="ariaid-title1">Admission Control and Query Queuing</h1>

  
  <div class="body conbody">
    <p class="p" id="admission_control__admission_control_intro"> Admission control is an Impala feature that
      imposes limits on concurrent SQL queries, to avoid resource usage spikes
      and out-of-memory conditions on busy clusters. The admission control
      feature lets you set an upper limit on the number of concurrent Impala
      queries and on the memory used by those queries. Any additional queries
      are queued until the earlier ones finish, rather than being cancelled or
      running slowly and causing contention. As other queries finish, the queued
      queries are allowed to proceed. </p>

    <p class="p"> In <span class="keyword">Impala 2.5</span> and higher, you can
      specify these limits and thresholds for each pool rather than globally.
      That way, you can balance the resource usage and throughput between steady
      well-defined workloads, rare resource-intensive queries, and ad-hoc
      exploratory queries. </p>

    <p class="p"> In addition to the threshold values for currently executing queries, you
      can place limits on the maximum number of queries that are queued
      (waiting) and a limit on the amount of time they might wait before
      returning with an error. These queue settings let you ensure that queries
      do not wait indefinitely so that you can detect and correct
        <span class="q">"starvation"</span> scenarios. </p>

    <p class="p"> Queries, DML statements, and some DDL statements, including
        <code class="ph codeph">CREATE TABLE AS SELECT</code> and <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE
        STATS</code> are affected by admission control. </p>

    <p class="p"> On a busy cluster, you might find there is an optimal number of Impala
      queries that run concurrently. For example, when the I/O capacity is fully
      utilized by I/O-intensive queries, you might not find any throughput
      benefit in running more concurrent queries. By allowing some queries to
      run at full speed while others wait, rather than having all queries
      contend for resources and run slowly, admission control can result in
      higher overall throughput. </p>

    <p class="p"> For another example, consider a memory-bound workload such as many large
      joins or aggregation queries. Each such query could briefly use many
      gigabytes of memory to process intermediate results. Because Impala by
      default cancels queries that exceed the specified memory limit, running
      multiple large-scale queries at once might require re-running some queries
      that are cancelled. In this case, admission control improves the
      reliability and stability of the overall workload by only allowing as many
      concurrent queries as the overall memory of the cluster can accommodate. </p>

    <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p"> One way to limit resource usage through admission control is to set an
        upper limit on the number of concurrent queries. This is the initial
        technique you might use when you do not have extensive information about
        memory usage for your workload. The settings can be specified separately
        for each dynamic resource pool. </p>

              The default value is unlimited for Impala 2.5 or higher.

 The maximum number of queries that can run
            concurrently in this pool. The default value is unlimited. Any
            queries for this pool that exceed <span class="ph uicontrol">Max Running
              Queries</span> are added to the admission control queue until
            other queries finish. You can use <span class="ph uicontrol">Max Running
              Queries</span> in the early stages of resource management,
            when you do not have extensive data about query memory usage, to
            determine if the cluster performs better overall if throttling is
            applied to Impala queries. <p class="p"> For a workload with many small
              queries, you typically specify a high value for this setting, or
              leave the default setting of <span class="q">"unlimited"</span>. For a workload with
              expensive queries, where some number of concurrent queries
              saturate the memory, I/O, CPU, or network capacity of the cluster,
              set the value low enough that the cluster resources are not
              overcommitted for Impala. </p>
<p class="p">Once you have enabled
              memory-based admission control using other pool settings, you can
              still use <span class="ph uicontrol">Max Running Queries</span> as a
              safeguard. If queries exceed either the total estimated memory or

                <span class="ph uicontrol">Queue Timeout</span> is not significant, and you
              can specify a high value to avoid canceling queries
                unexpectedly:<ul class="ul" id="admission_concurrency__ul_kzr_rbg_gw">
                <li class="li">In a low-concurrency workload where few or no queries are

                <li class="li">In an environment without a strict SLA, where it does not
                  matter if queries occasionally take longer than usual because
                  they are held in admission control</li>

              </ul>
You might also need to increase the value to use Impala with
              some business intelligence tools that have their own timeout
              intervals for queries. </div>
<p class="p">In a high-concurrency workload,
              especially for queries with a tight SLA, long wait times in
              admission control can cause a serious problem. For example, if a
              query needs to run in 10 seconds, and you have tuned it so that it
              runs in 8 seconds, it violates its SLA if it waits in the
              admission control queue longer than 2 seconds. In a case like
              this, set a low timeout value and monitor how many queries are
              cancelled because of timeouts. This technique helps you to
              discover capacity, tuning, and scaling problems early, and helps
              avoid wasting resources by running expensive queries that have
              already missed their SLA. </p>
<p class="p"> If you identify some queries
              that can have a high timeout value, and others that benefit from a
              low timeout value, you can create separate pools with different
              values for this setting. </p>

          </dd>

        
      </dl>

      <p class="p"> You can combine these settings with the memory-based approach
        described in <a class="xref" href="impala_admission.html#admission_memory">Memory Limits and Admission Control</a>. If
        either the maximum number of or the expected memory usage of the
        concurrent queries is exceeded, subsequent queries are queued until the
        concurrent workload falls below the threshold again. </p>

              Impala determines the expected maximum memory used by all

            </p>

            <p class="p">
              You set Max Memory in <code class="ph codeph">fair-scheduler.xml</code> file

            </p>

            <p class="p">
              If you specify Max Memory, you should specify the amount of
              memory to allocate to each query in this pool. You can do this in
              two ways:
            </p>

            <ul class="ul">
              <li class="li">By setting Maximum Query Memory Limit and Minimum Query Memory

            <div class="p">
              Note that in the following cases, Impala will rely entirely on

              each query. This is not recommended because it can result in
              queries not running or being starved for memory if the estimates
              are inaccurate. And it can affect other queries running on the

              will choose a memory limit between the minimum and maximum values

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title6">How Impala Admission Control Relates to Other Resource Management Tools</h2>

  

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        The admission control feature is similar in some ways to the YARN resource management framework. These features
        can be used separately or together. This section describes some similarities and differences, to help you
        decide which combination of resource management features to use for Impala.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        Admission control is a lightweight, decentralized system that is suitable for workloads consisting
        primarily of Impala queries and other SQL statements. It sets <span class="q">"soft"</span> limits that smooth out Impala
        memory usage during times of heavy load, rather than taking an all-or-nothing approach that cancels jobs
        that are too resource-intensive.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        Because the admission control system does not interact with other Hadoop workloads such as MapReduce jobs, you
        might use YARN with static service pools on clusters where resources are shared between
        Impala and other Hadoop components. This configuration is recommended when using Impala in a
        <dfn class="term">multitenant</dfn> cluster. Devote a percentage of cluster resources to Impala, and allocate another
        percentage for MapReduce and other batch-style workloads. Let admission control handle the concurrency and
        memory usage for the Impala work within the cluster, and let YARN manage the work for other components within the
        cluster. In this scenario, Impala's resources are not managed by YARN.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        The Impala admission control feature uses the same configuration mechanism as the YARN resource manager to map users to
        pools and authenticate them.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        Although the Impala admission control feature uses a <code class="ph codeph">fair-scheduler.xml</code> configuration file
        behind the scenes, this file does not depend on which scheduler is used for YARN. You still use this file
        even when YARN is using the capacity scheduler.

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title7">How Impala Schedules and Enforces Limits on Concurrent Queries</h2>

  

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        The admission control system is decentralized, embedded in each Impala daemon and communicating through the
        statestore mechanism. Although the limits you set for memory usage and number of concurrent queries apply
        cluster-wide, each Impala daemon makes its own decisions about whether to allow each query to run
        immediately or to queue it for a less-busy time. These decisions are fast, meaning the admission control
        mechanism is low-overhead, but might be imprecise during times of heavy load across many coordinators. There could be times when the
        more queries were queued (in aggregate across the cluster) than the specified limit, or when number of admitted queries
        exceeds the expected number. Thus, you typically err on the
        high side for the size of the queue, because there is not a big penalty for having a large number of queued
        queries; and you typically err on the low side for configuring memory resources, to leave some headroom in case more
        queries are admitted than expected, without running out of memory and being cancelled as a result.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        To avoid a large backlog of queued requests, you can set an upper limit on the size of the queue for
        queries that are queued. When the number of queued queries exceeds this limit, further queries are
        cancelled rather than being queued. You can also configure a timeout period per pool, after which queued queries are
        cancelled, to avoid indefinite waits. If a cluster reaches this state where queries are cancelled due to
        too many concurrent requests or long waits for query execution to begin, that is a signal for an
        administrator to take action, either by provisioning more resources, scheduling work on the cluster to
        smooth out the load, or by doing <a class="xref" href="impala_performance.html#performance">Impala performance
        tuning</a> to enable higher throughput.

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title8">How Admission Control works with Impala Clients (JDBC, ODBC, HiveServer2)</h2>

  

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        Most aspects of admission control work transparently with client interfaces such as JDBC and ODBC:
      </p>


      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">
          If a SQL statement is put into a queue rather than running immediately, the API call blocks until the
          statement is dequeued and begins execution. At that point, the client program can request to fetch
          results, which might also block until results become available.
        </li>


        <li class="li">
          If a SQL statement is cancelled because it has been queued for too long or because it exceeded the memory
          limit during execution, the error is returned to the client program with a descriptive error message.
        </li>


      </ul>


      <p class="p"> In Impala 2.0 and higher, you can submit a SQL
          <code class="ph codeph">SET</code> statement from the client application to change
        the <code class="ph codeph">REQUEST_POOL</code> query option. This option lets you
        submit queries to different resource pools, as described in <a class="xref" href="impala_request_pool.html#request_pool">REQUEST_POOL Query Option</a>.  </p>


      <p class="p">
        At any time, the set of queued queries could include queries submitted through multiple different Impala
        daemon hosts. All the queries submitted through a particular host will be executed in order, so a
        <code class="ph codeph">CREATE TABLE</code> followed by an <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code> on the same table would succeed.
        Queries submitted through different hosts are not guaranteed to be executed in the order they were
        received. Therefore, if you are using load-balancing or other round-robin scheduling where different
        statements are submitted through different hosts, set up all table structures ahead of time so that the
        statements controlled by the queuing system are primarily queries, where order is not significant. Or, if a
        sequence of statements needs to happen in strict order (such as an <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code> followed by a
        <code class="ph codeph">SELECT</code>), submit all those statements through a single session, while connected to the same
        Impala daemon host.
      </p>


      <p class="p">
        Admission control has the following limitations or special behavior when used with JDBC or ODBC

    <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">
        When queries complete quickly and are tuned for optimal memory usage, there is less chance of
        performance or capacity problems during times of heavy load. Before setting up admission control,
        tune your Impala queries to ensure that the query plans are efficient and the memory estimates
        are accurate. Understanding the nature of your workload, and which queries are the most
        resource-intensive, helps you to plan how to divide the queries into different pools and
        decide what limits to define for each pool.
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        For large tables, especially those involved in join queries, keep their statistics up to date
        after loading substantial amounts of new data or adding new partitions.
        Use the <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE STATS</code> statement for unpartitioned tables, and
        <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS</code> for partitioned tables.
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        When you use dynamic resource pools with a <span class="ph uicontrol">Max Memory</span> setting enabled,
        you typically override the memory estimates that Impala makes based on the statistics from the
        <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE STATS</code> statement.
        You either set the <code class="ph codeph">MEM_LIMIT</code> query option within a particular session to
        set an upper memory limit for queries within that session, or a default <code class="ph codeph">MEM_LIMIT</code>
        setting for all queries processed by the <span class="keyword cmdname">impalad</span> instance, or
        a default <code class="ph codeph">MEM_LIMIT</code> setting for all queries assigned to a particular
        dynamic resource pool. By designating a consistent memory limit for a set of similar queries
        that use the same resource pool, you avoid unnecessary query queuing or out-of-memory conditions
        that can arise during high-concurrency workloads when memory estimates for some queries are inaccurate.

        them. These decisions rely on information passed back and forth between
        nodes by the StateStore service. If a sudden surge in requests causes
        more queries than anticipated to run concurrently, then the throughput
        could decrease due to queries spilling to disk or contending for
