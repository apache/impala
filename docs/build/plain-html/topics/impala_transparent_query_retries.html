  <div class="body conbody">
    <p class="p">Transparent query retries will automatically retry any queries that fail
      due to cluster membership changes. A cluster membership change typically
      entails a node leaving the cluster before it crashed or for some other
      reason stopped responding to statestore heartbeats.</p>

    <p class="p">Traditionally, if a query runs on a node in the Impala cluster, and that
      node crashes, then the query will fail and it is up to the user to retry
      the query. With transparent query retries, the query will be automatically
      retried.</p>

    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">Queries are only retried if the query failed due to a cluster membership
        change. Trivial failures, like SQL parsing exceptions are <strong class="ph b">not</strong>
        retried.</li>

      <li class="li">Cluster membership changes fall into two categories: membership updates
        from the statestore or node blacklisting events. <p class="p">impalads periodically
        send heartbeats to the statestore, if an impalad stops sending heartbeats
        to the statestore then that impalad is removed from the cluster
        membership</p>
<p class="p">Node blacklisting events occur when a query fails and as
        a result, an impalad in the cluster is added to the Coordinator's node
        blacklist. In this scenario, the query is retried.</p>
</li>

      <li class="li">For most users, query retries will be completely transparent, but
        users who want to know why a retry was necessary can use runtime profiles.
        Each query attempt is modelled as a completely new query. Thus, each query
        attempt has its own runtime profiles. Users can look through the profiles
        of the failed query attempts to determine why the query was retried.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="p">Transparent query retries are turned off by default, but can be enabled via
      the <code class="ph codeph">RETRY_FAILED_QUERIES</code> query option.</p>
