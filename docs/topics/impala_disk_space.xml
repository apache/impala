    <p>
      Although Impala typically works with many large files in an HDFS storage system with
      plenty of capacity, there are times when you might perform some file cleanup to reclaim
      space, or advise developers on techniques to minimize space consumption and file
      duplication.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use compact binary file formats where practical. Numeric and time-based data in
          particular can be stored in more compact form in binary data files. Depending on the
          file format, various compression and encoding features can reduce file size even
          further. You can specify the <codeph>STORED AS</codeph> clause as part of the
          <codeph>CREATE TABLE</codeph> statement, or <codeph>ALTER TABLE</codeph> with the
          <codeph>SET FILEFORMAT</codeph> clause for an existing table or partition within a
          partitioned table. See <xref
            href="impala_file_formats.xml#file_formats"/>
          for details about file formats, especially <xref href="impala_parquet.xml#parquet"/>.
          See <xref href="impala_create_table.xml#create_table"/> and
          <xref
            href="impala_alter_table.xml#alter_table"/> for syntax details.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          You manage underlying data files differently depending on whether the corresponding
          Impala table is defined as an
          <xref
            href="impala_tables.xml#internal_tables">internal</xref> or
          <xref
            href="impala_tables.xml#external_tables">external</xref> table:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use the <codeph>DESCRIBE FORMATTED</codeph> statement to check if a particular table
            is internal (managed by Impala) or external, and to see the physical location of the
            data files in HDFS. See <xref
              href="impala_describe.xml#describe"/>
            for details.
          </li>

          <li>
            For Impala-managed (<q>internal</q>) tables, use <codeph>DROP TABLE</codeph>
            statements to remove data files. See
            <xref
              href="impala_drop_table.xml#drop_table"/> for details.
          </li>

          <li>
            For tables not managed by Impala (<q>external</q> tables), use appropriate
            HDFS-related commands such as <codeph>hadoop fs</codeph>, <codeph>hdfs dfs</codeph>,
            or <codeph>distcp</codeph>, to create, move, copy, or delete files within HDFS
            directories that are accessible by the <codeph>impala</codeph> user. Issue a
            <codeph>REFRESH <varname>table_name</varname></codeph> statement after adding or
            removing any files from the data directory of an external table. See
            <xref href="impala_refresh.xml#refresh"/> for details.
          </li>

          <li>
            Use external tables to reference HDFS data files in their original location. With
            this technique, you avoid copying the files, and you can map more than one Impala
            table to the same set of data files. When you drop the Impala table, the data files
            are left undisturbed. See <xref href="impala_tables.xml#external_tables"/> for
            details.
          </li>

          <li>
            Use the <codeph>LOAD DATA</codeph> statement to move HDFS files into the data
            directory for an Impala table from inside Impala, without the need to specify the
            HDFS path of the destination directory. This technique works for both internal and
            external tables. See <xref href="impala_load_data.xml#load_data"/> for details.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Make sure that the HDFS trashcan is configured correctly. When you remove files from
          HDFS, the space might not be reclaimed for use by other files until sometime later,
          when the trashcan is emptied. See <xref href="impala_drop_table.xml#drop_table"/> for
          details. See <xref href="impala_prereqs.xml#prereqs_account"/> for permissions needed
          for the HDFS trashcan to operate correctly.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Drop all tables in a database before dropping the database itself. See
          <xref href="impala_drop_database.xml#drop_database"/> for details.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Clean up temporary files after failed <codeph>INSERT</codeph> statements. If an
          <codeph>INSERT</codeph> statement encounters an error, and you see a directory named
          <filepath>.impala_insert_staging</filepath> or
          <filepath>_impala_insert_staging</filepath> left behind in the data directory for the
          table, it might contain temporary data files taking up space in HDFS. You might be
          able to salvage these data files, for example if they are complete but could not be
          moved into place due to a permission error. Or, you might delete those files through
          commands such as <codeph>hadoop fs</codeph> or <codeph>hdfs dfs</codeph>, to reclaim
          space before re-trying the <codeph>INSERT</codeph>. Issue <codeph>DESCRIBE FORMATTED
          <varname>table_name</varname></codeph> to see the HDFS path where you can check for
          temporary files.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you use the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) as a place to offload data to reduce
          the volume of local storage, Impala 2.2.0 and higher can query the data directly from
          S3. See <xref
            href="impala_s3.xml#s3"/> for details.

      <title>Configuring Scratch Space for Spilling to Disk</title>Impala uses intermediate files during large
      sort, join, aggregation, or analytic function operations The files are
      removed when the operation finishes. You can specify locations of the
      intermediate files by starting the <cmdname>impalad</cmdname> daemon with
      the
          <codeph>&#8209;&#8209;scratch_dirs="<varname>path_to_directory</varname>"</codeph>
      configuration option. By default, intermediate files are stored in the
      directory <filepath>/tmp/impala-scratch</filepath>.<p
        id="order_by_scratch_dir">
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can specify a single directory or a comma-separated list of directories.
          </li>

          <li>
            You can specify an optional a capacity quota per scratch directory using the colon
            (:) as the delimiter.
            <p>
              The capacity quota of <codeph>-1</codeph> or <codeph>0</codeph> is the same as no
              quota for the directory.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            The scratch directories must be on the local filesystem, not in HDFS.
          </li>

          <li>
            You might specify different directory paths for different hosts, depending on the
            capacity and speed of the available storage devices.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        If there is less than 1 GB free on the filesystem where that directory resides, Impala
        still runs, but writes a warning message to its log.
      </p>

      <p>
        Impala successfully starts (with a warning written to the log) if it cannot create or
        read and write files in one of the scratch directories.

      <title>Priority Based Scratch Directory Selection</title>
      <p>The location of the intermediate files are configured by starting the impalad daemon with
        the flag ‑‑scratch_dirs="path_to_directory". Currently this startup flag uses the configured
        scratch directories in a round robin fashion. Automatic selection of scratch directories in
        a round robin fashion may not always be ideal in every situation since these directories
        could come from different classes of storage system volumes having different performance
        characteristics (SSD vs HDD, local storage vs network attached storage, etc.). To optimize
        your workload, you have an option to configure the priority of the scratch directories based
        on your storage system configuration.</p>
      <p>The scratch directories will be selected for spilling based on how you configure the
        priorities of the directories and if you provide the same priority for multiple directories
        then the directories will be selected in a round robin fashion.</p>
      <p>The valid formats for specifying the priority directories are as shown here:
        <codeblock>
          &lt;dir-path>:&lt;limit>:&lt;priority>
          &lt;dir-path>::&lt;priority>
</codeblock></p>
        <p>Example:</p>
      <p>
        <codeblock>
        /dir1:200GB:0
        /dir1::0
</codeblock>
      </p>
      <p>The following formats use the default priority:
        <codeblock>
        /dir1
        /dir1:200GB
        /dir1:200GB:
</codeblock>
      </p>
      <p>In the example below, dir1 will be used as a spill victim until it is full and then dir2, dir3,
        and dir4 will be used in a round robin fashion.</p>
      <p>
        <codeblock>‑‑scratch_dirs="/dir1:200GB:0, /dir2:1024GB:1, /dir3:1024GB:1, /dir4:1024GB:1"
</codeblock>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Increasing Scratch Capacity</title>
      <p> You can compress the data spilled to disk to increase the effective scratch capacity. You
        typically more than double capacity using compression and reduce spilling to disk. Use the
        --disk_spill_compression_codec and –-disk_spill_punch_holes startup options. The
        --disk_spill_compression_codec takes any value supported by the COMPRESSION_CODEC query
        option. The value is not case-sensitive. A value of <codeph>ZSTD</codeph> or
          <codeph>LZ4</codeph> is recommended (default is NONE).</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
<codeblock>--disk_spill_compression_codec=LZ4
--disk_spill_punch_holes=true
</codeblock>
      <p>
        If you set <codeph>--disk_spill_compression_codec</codeph> to a value other than <codeph>NONE</codeph>, you must set <codeph>--disk_spill_punch_holes</codeph> to true.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hole punching feature supported by many filesystems is used to reclaim space in scratch files during execution
        of a query that spills to disk. This results in lower scratch space requirements in many cases, especially when
        combined with disk spill compression. When this option is not enabled, scratch space is still recycled by a query,
        but less effectively in many cases.
      </p>
      <p> You can specify a compression level for <codeph>ZSTD</codeph> only. For example: </p>
<codeblock>--disk_spill_compression_codec=ZSTD:10
--disk_spill_punch_holes=true
</codeblock>
      <p> Compression levels from 1 up to 22 (default 3) are supported for <codeph>ZSTD</codeph>.
        The lower the compression level, the faster the speed at the cost of compression ratio.</p>
