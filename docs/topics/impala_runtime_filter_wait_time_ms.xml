      <indexterm audience="hidden">RUNTIME_FILTER_WAIT_TIME_MS query option</indexterm>
      The <codeph>RUNTIME_FILTER_WAIT_TIME_MS</codeph> query option
      adjusts the settings for the runtime filtering feature.
      It specifies a time in milliseconds that each scan node waits for
      runtime filters to be produced by other plan fragments.
      Note that the wait time for a runtime filter is with respect to the start of
      processing the query in the given executor instead of the beginning of the Open
      phase of a scan node. For instance, a scan node could start so late that at the
      beginning of the Open phase of the scan node, the amount of time passed since the
      start of query processing was already greater than the value of
      <codeph>RUNTIME_FILTER_WAIT_TIME_MS</codeph>. In such a case, even though the
      runtime filter has not arrived yet, the scan node will not wait any longer.
