    <p>
      The <codeph>RESOURCE_TRACE_RATIO</codeph> query option specifies the ratio of queries
      where the CPU usage info will be included in the profiles. Collecting CPU usage and
      sending it around adds a slight overhead during query execution. This query option lets
      you control whether to collect additional information to diagnose the resource usage.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, setting <codeph>RESOURCE_TRACE_RATIO=1</codeph> adds a trace of the CPU usage
      to the profile of each query.
    </p>

    <p>
      Setting <codeph>RESOURCE_TRACE_RATIO=0.5</codeph> means that randomly selected half of all
      queries will have that information collected by the coordinator and included in the
      profiles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Setting <codeph>RESOURCE_TRACE_RATIO=0</codeph> means that CPU usage will not be tracked
      and included in the profiles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Values from 0 to 1 are allowed.
