    <p id="admission_control_intro"> Admission control is an Impala feature that
      limits the number of concurrently running queries to avoid resource usage
      spikes and out-of-memory conditions on busy clusters. New queries are
      accepted and executed until certain a threshold is reached, such as too
      many queries or too much total memory used across the cluster. When one of
      these thresholds is reached, incoming queries are queued and are admitted
      (that is, begin executing) when the resources become available. </p>
    <p> In addition to the threshold values for currently executing queries, you
      can place limits on the maximum number of queries that are queued,
      waiting, and a limit on the amount of time they might wait before
      returning with an error. These queue settings let you ensure that queries
      do not wait indefinitely so that you can detect and correct
        <q>starvation</q> scenarios. </p>
    <p>
      Queries, DML statements, and some DDL statements, including
        <codeph>CREATE TABLE AS SELECT</codeph> and <codeph>COMPUTE
        STATS</codeph> are affected by admission control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enable this feature if your cluster is
      underutilized at some times and overutilized at others. Overutilization is indicated by performance
      bottlenecks and queries being cancelled due to out-of-memory conditions, when those same queries are
      successful and perform well during times with less concurrent load. Admission control works as a safeguard to
      avoid out-of-memory conditions during heavy concurrent usage.

    <title>Overview of Impala Admission Control</title>

    <conbody>

      <p>
        On a busy cluster, you might find there is an optimal number of Impala queries that run concurrently.
        For example, when the I/O capacity is fully utilized by I/O-intensive queries,
        you might not find any throughput benefit in running more concurrent queries.
        By allowing some queries to run at full speed while others wait, rather than having
        all queries contend for resources and run slowly, admission control can result in higher overall throughput.
      </p>

      <p> For another example, consider a memory-bound workload such as many
        large joins or aggregation queries. Each such query could briefly use
        many gigabytes of memory to process intermediate results. Because Impala
        by default cancels queries that exceed the specified memory limit,
        running multiple large-scale queries at once might require re-running
        some queries that are cancelled. In this case, admission control
        improves the reliability and stability of the overall workload by only
        allowing as many concurrent queries as the overall memory of the cluster
        can accommodate. </p>

      <p>
        The admission control feature lets you set an upper limit on the number of concurrent Impala
        queries and on the memory used by those queries. Any additional queries are queued until the earlier ones
        finish, rather than being cancelled or running slowly and causing contention. As other queries finish, the
        queued queries are allowed to proceed.
      </p>

      <p rev="2.5.0">
        In <keyword keyref="impala25_full"/> and higher, you can specify these limits and thresholds for each
        pool rather than globally. That way, you can balance the resource usage and throughput
        between steady well-defined workloads, rare resource-intensive queries, and ad hoc
        exploratory queries.

    <title>Concurrent Queries and Admission Control</title>
    <conbody>
      <p>
        One way to limit resource usage through admission control is to set an upper limit
        on the number of concurrent queries. This is the initial technique you might use
        when you do not have extensive information about memory usage for your workload.
        This setting can be specified separately for each dynamic resource pool.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can combine this setting with the memory-based approach described in
        <xref href="impala_admission.xml#admission_memory"/>. If either the maximum number of
        or the expected memory usage of the concurrent queries is exceeded, subsequent queries
        are queued until the concurrent workload falls below the threshold again.

  <concept id="admission_memory">
    <title>Memory Limits and Admission Control</title>
    <conbody>
      <p>
        Each dynamic resource pool can have an upper limit on the cluster-wide memory used by queries executing in that pool.
        This is the technique to use once you have a stable workload with well-understood memory requirements.
      </p>
      <p>Use the following settings to manage memory-based admission
        control.</p>
      <dl>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Max Memory</dt>
          <dd>The maximum amount of aggregate memory available across the
            cluster to all queries executing in this pool. This should be a
            portion of the aggregate configured memory for Impala daemons, which
            will be shown in the settings dialog next to this option for
            convenience. Setting this to a non-zero value enables memory based
            admission control.<p>Impala determines the expected maximum memory
              used by all queries in the pool and holds back any further queries
              that would result in Max Memory being exceeded. </p><p>You set Max
              Memory in <codeph>fair-scheduler.xml</codeph> file with the
                <codeph>maxResources</codeph> tag. For example:
                <codeph>&lt;maxResources>2500
              mb&lt;/maxResources></codeph></p><p>If you specify Max Memory, you
              should specify the amount of memory to allocate to each query in
              this pool. You can do this in two ways:</p><ul>
              <li>By setting Maximum Query Memory Limit and Minimum Query Memory
                Limit. This is preferred in <keyword keyref="impala31_full"/>
                and greater and gives Impala flexibility to set aside more
                memory to queries that are expected to be memory-hungry.</li>
              <li>By setting Default Query Memory Limit to the exact amount of
                memory that Impala should set aside for queries in that
                pool.</li>
            </ul><p>Note that if you do not set any of the above options, or set
              Default Query Memory Limit to 0, Impala will rely entirely on
              memory estimates to determine how much memory to set aside for
              each query. This is not recommended because it can result in
              queries not running or being starved for memory if the estimates
              are inaccurate.</p></dd>

        <dlentry>
          <dt>Minimum Query Memory Limit and Maximum Query Memory Limit</dt>
          <dd>These two options determine the minimum and maximum per-host
            memory limit that will be chosen by Impala Admission control for
            queries in this resource pool. If set, Impala Admission Control will
            choose a memory limit between the minimum and maximum values based
            on the per-host memory estimate for the query. The memory limit
            chosen determines the amount of memory that Impala Admission control
            will set aside for this query on each host that the query is running
            on. The aggregate memory across all of the hosts that the query is

    <title>How Impala Admission Control Relates to Other Resource Management Tools</title>

      <p>
        The admission control feature is similar in some ways to the YARN resource management framework. These features
        can be used separately or together. This section describes some similarities and differences, to help you
        decide which combination of resource management features to use for Impala.
      </p>

      <p>
        Admission control is a lightweight, decentralized system that is suitable for workloads consisting
        primarily of Impala queries and other SQL statements. It sets <q>soft</q> limits that smooth out Impala
        memory usage during times of heavy load, rather than taking an all-or-nothing approach that cancels jobs
        that are too resource-intensive.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because the admission control system does not interact with other Hadoop workloads such as MapReduce jobs, you
        might use YARN with static service pools on clusters where resources are shared between
        Impala and other Hadoop components. This configuration is recommended when using Impala in a
        <term>multitenant</term> cluster. Devote a percentage of cluster resources to Impala, and allocate another
        percentage for MapReduce and other batch-style workloads. Let admission control handle the concurrency and
        memory usage for the Impala work within the cluster, and let YARN manage the work for other components within the
        cluster. In this scenario, Impala's resources are not managed by YARN.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Impala admission control feature uses the same configuration mechanism as the YARN resource manager to map users to
        pools and authenticate them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although the Impala admission control feature uses a <codeph>fair-scheduler.xml</codeph> configuration file
        behind the scenes, this file does not depend on which scheduler is used for YARN. You still use this file
        even when YARN is using the capacity scheduler.

  </prolog>

    <conbody>

      <p>
        The admission control system is decentralized, embedded in each Impala daemon and communicating through the
        statestore mechanism. Although the limits you set for memory usage and number of concurrent queries apply
        cluster-wide, each Impala daemon makes its own decisions about whether to allow each query to run
        immediately or to queue it for a less-busy time. These decisions are fast, meaning the admission control
        mechanism is low-overhead, but might be imprecise during times of heavy load across many coordinators. There could be times when the
        more queries were queued (in aggregate across the cluster) than the specified limit, or when number of admitted queries
        exceeds the expected number. Thus, you typically err on the
        high side for the size of the queue, because there is not a big penalty for having a large number of queued
        queries; and you typically err on the low side for configuring memory resources, to leave some headroom in case more
        queries are admitted than expected, without running out of memory and being cancelled as a result.
      </p>

      <p>
        To avoid a large backlog of queued requests, you can set an upper limit on the size of the queue for
        queries that are queued. When the number of queued queries exceeds this limit, further queries are
        cancelled rather than being queued. You can also configure a timeout period per pool, after which queued queries are
        cancelled, to avoid indefinite waits. If a cluster reaches this state where queries are cancelled due to
        too many concurrent requests or long waits for query execution to begin, that is a signal for an
        administrator to take action, either by provisioning more resources, scheduling work on the cluster to
        smooth out the load, or by doing <xref href="impala_performance.xml#performance">Impala performance
        tuning</xref> to enable higher throughput.

    <conbody>

      <p>
        Most aspects of admission control work transparently with client interfaces such as JDBC and ODBC:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          If a SQL statement is put into a queue rather than running immediately, the API call blocks until the
          statement is dequeued and begins execution. At that point, the client program can request to fetch
          results, which might also block until results become available.
        </li>

        <li>
          If a SQL statement is cancelled because it has been queued for too long or because it exceeded the memory
          limit during execution, the error is returned to the client program with a descriptive error message.
        </li>

      </ul>

      <p rev="">
        In Impala 2.0 and higher, you can submit
        a SQL <codeph>SET</codeph> statement from the client application
        to change the <codeph>REQUEST_POOL</codeph> query option.
        This option lets you submit queries to different resource pools,
        as described in <xref href="impala_request_pool.xml#request_pool"/>.
<!-- Commenting out as starting to be too old to mention.
        Prior to Impala 2.0, that option was only settable
        for a session through the <cmdname>impala-shell</cmdname> <codeph>SET</codeph> command, or cluster-wide through an
        <cmdname>impalad</cmdname> startup option.
-->
      </p>

      <p>
        At any time, the set of queued queries could include queries submitted through multiple different Impala
        daemon hosts. All the queries submitted through a particular host will be executed in order, so a
        <codeph>CREATE TABLE</codeph> followed by an <codeph>INSERT</codeph> on the same table would succeed.
        Queries submitted through different hosts are not guaranteed to be executed in the order they were
        received. Therefore, if you are using load-balancing or other round-robin scheduling where different
        statements are submitted through different hosts, set up all table structures ahead of time so that the
        statements controlled by the queuing system are primarily queries, where order is not significant. Or, if a
        sequence of statements needs to happen in strict order (such as an <codeph>INSERT</codeph> followed by a
        <codeph>SELECT</codeph>), submit all those statements through a single session, while connected to the same
        Impala daemon host.
      </p>

      <p>
        Admission control has the following limitations or special behavior when used with JDBC or ODBC
        applications:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The other resource-related query options,
          <codeph>RESERVATION_REQUEST_TIMEOUT</codeph> and <codeph>V_CPU_CORES</codeph>, are no longer used. Those query options only
          applied to using Impala with Llama, which is no longer supported.

      </ul>

    <title>SQL and Schema Considerations for Admission Control</title>
    <conbody>
      <p>
        When queries complete quickly and are tuned for optimal memory usage, there is less chance of
        performance or capacity problems during times of heavy load. Before setting up admission control,
        tune your Impala queries to ensure that the query plans are efficient and the memory estimates
        are accurate. Understanding the nature of your workload, and which queries are the most
        resource-intensive, helps you to plan how to divide the queries into different pools and
        decide what limits to define for each pool.
      </p>
      <p>
        For large tables, especially those involved in join queries, keep their statistics up to date
        after loading substantial amounts of new data or adding new partitions.
        Use the <codeph>COMPUTE STATS</codeph> statement for unpartitioned tables, and
        <codeph>COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS</codeph> for partitioned tables.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use dynamic resource pools with a <uicontrol>Max Memory</uicontrol> setting enabled,
        you typically override the memory estimates that Impala makes based on the statistics from the
        <codeph>COMPUTE STATS</codeph> statement.
        You either set the <codeph>MEM_LIMIT</codeph> query option within a particular session to
        set an upper memory limit for queries within that session, or a default <codeph>MEM_LIMIT</codeph>
        setting for all queries processed by the <cmdname>impalad</cmdname> instance, or
        a default <codeph>MEM_LIMIT</codeph> setting for all queries assigned to a particular
        dynamic resource pool. By designating a consistent memory limit for a set of similar queries
        that use the same resource pool, you avoid unnecessary query queuing or out-of-memory conditions
        that can arise during high-concurrency workloads when memory estimates for some queries are inaccurate.

      <title>Configuring Admission Control Using the Command Line</title>

      <conbody>

        <p>
          To configure admission control, use a combination of startup options for the Impala daemon and edit
          or create the configuration files <filepath>fair-scheduler.xml</filepath> and
            <filepath>llama-site.xml</filepath>.
        </p>

        <p>
          For a straightforward configuration using a single resource pool named <codeph>default</codeph>, you can
          specify configuration options on the command line and skip the <filepath>fair-scheduler.xml</filepath>
          and <filepath>llama-site.xml</filepath> configuration files.
        </p>

        <p> For an advanced configuration with multiple resource pools using
          different settings:<ol>
            <li>Set up the <filepath>fair-scheduler.xml</filepath> and
                <filepath>llama-site.xml</filepath> configuration files
              manually.</li>
            <li>Provide the paths to each one using the
                <cmdname>impalad</cmdname> command-line options,
                <codeph>--fair_scheduler_allocation_path</codeph> and
                <codeph>--llama_site_path</codeph> respectively. </li>
          </ol></p>

        <p> The Impala admission control feature uses the Fair Scheduler
          configuration settings to determine how to map users and groups to
          different resource pools. For example, you might set up different
          resource pools with separate memory limits, and maximum number of
          concurrent and queued queries, for different categories of users
          within your organization. For details about all the Fair Scheduler
          configuration settings, see the <xref

        <p> Here are sample <filepath>fair-scheduler.xml</filepath> and

        <p>
          Each <codeph>&lt;aclSubmitApps&gt;</codeph> tag (other than the one for <codeph>root</codeph>) contains

        <p>
          If you leave the <codeph>&lt;aclSubmitApps&gt;</codeph> element empty for a pool, nobody can submit
          directly to that pool; child pools can specify their own <codeph>&lt;aclSubmitApps&gt;</codeph> values

        <p> The limits imposed by admission control are de-centrally managed
            <q>soft</q> limits. Each Impala coordinator node makes its own
          decisions about whether to allow queries to run immediately or to
          queue them. These decisions rely on information passed back and forth
          between nodes by the StateStore service. If a sudden surge in requests
          causes more queries than anticipated to run concurrently, then the
          throughput could decrease due to queries spilling to disk or
          contending for resources. Or queries could be cancelled if they exceed
          the <codeph>MEM_LIMIT</codeph> setting while running. </p>
        <p>
          In <cmdname>impala-shell</cmdname>, you can also specify which
          resource pool to direct queries to by setting the
            <codeph>REQUEST_POOL</codeph> query option.
        </p>

                information at log level 1, more detailed information at log
                level 2). </p><p>The profile output contains details about the
                admission decision, such as whether the query was queued or not
                and which resource pool it was assigned to. It also includes the
                estimated and actual memory usage for the query, so you can
