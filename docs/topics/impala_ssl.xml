    <p>
      Impala supports TLS/SSL network encryption, between Impala and client programs, and
      between the Impala-related daemons running on different nodes in the cluster. This feature
      is important when you also use other features such as Kerberos authentication or Ranger
      authorization, where credentials are being transmitted back and forth.

    <title>Using the Command Line</title>

    <conbody>

      <p>
        To enable TLS/SSL for client applications to connect to Impala, add both of the
        following flags to the <cmdname>impalad</cmdname> startup options:
      </p>

      <ul id="ul_i2p_m2d_rp">
        <li>
          <codeph>--ssl_server_certificate</codeph>: The full path to the server certificate, on
          the local filesystem.
        </li>

        <li>
          <codeph>--ssl_private_key</codeph>: The full path to the server private key, on the
          local filesystem.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p rev="2.3.0">
        In <keyword keyref="impala23_full"/> and higher, Impala can also use SSL for its own
        internal communication between the <cmdname>impalad</cmdname>,
        <codeph>statestored</codeph>, and <codeph>catalogd</codeph> daemons. To enable this
        additional SSL encryption, set the <codeph>--ssl_server_certificate</codeph> and
        <codeph>--ssl_private_key</codeph> flags in the startup options for
        <cmdname>impalad</cmdname>, <cmdname>catalogd</cmdname>, and
        <cmdname>statestored</cmdname>, and also add the
        <codeph>--ssl_client_ca_certificate</codeph> flag for all three of those daemons.
      </p>

      <note conref="../shared/impala_common.xml#common/impala_kerberos_ssl_caveat"/>

      <p>
        If either of these flags are set, both must be set. In that case, Impala starts
        listening for Beeswax and HiveServer2 requests on SSL-secured ports only. (The port
        numbers stay the same; see <xref href="impala_ports.xml#ports"/> for details.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Since Impala uses passphrase-less certificates in PEM format, you can reuse a host's
        existing Java keystore by using the <codeph>openssl</codeph> toolkit to convert it to
        the PEM format.

        <p> With TLS/SSL enabled for Impala, start

        <ul id="ul_kgp_m2d_rp">

          installations). </p>

          on the cluster that <cmdname>impala-shell</cmdname> runs on must be
          2.7.9 or higher (or a vendor-provided Python version with the required
          support. Some vendors patched Python 2.7.5 versions on Red Hat
          Enterprise Linux 7 and derivatives).</p>

      <p>
        You can use Kerberos authentication, TLS/SSL encryption, or both to secure connections
        from JDBC and ODBC applications to Impala. See
        <xref href="impala_jdbc.xml#impala_jdbc"/> and
        <xref href="impala_odbc.xml#impala_odbc"/> for details.

    <title>Specifying TLS/SSL Minimum Allowed Version and Ciphers</title>

    <conbody>

      <p>
        Depending on your cluster configuration and the security practices in your organization,
        you might need to restrict the allowed versions of TLS/SSL used by Impala. Older TLS/SSL
        versions might have vulnerabilities or lack certain features. In
        <keyword keyref="impala210_full"/>, you can use startup options for the
        <cmdname>impalad</cmdname>, <cmdname>catalogd</cmdname>, and
        <cmdname>statestored</cmdname> daemons to specify a minimum allowed version of TLS/SSL.
      </p>

      <p>
        Specify one of the following values for the <codeph>--ssl_minimum_version</codeph>
        configuration setting:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <codeph>tlsv1</codeph>: Allow any TLS version of 1.0 or higher.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <codeph>tlsv1.1</codeph>: Allow any TLS version of 1.1 or higher.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <codeph>tlsv1.2</codeph>: Allow any TLS version of 1.2 or higher.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The default version was changed from 'tlsv1' to 'tlsv1.2' starting in <keyword keyref="impala40"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        Along with specifying the version, you can also specify the allowed set of TLS ciphers
        by using the <codeph>--ssl_cipher_list</codeph> configuration setting. The argument to
        this option is a list of keywords, separated by colons, commas, or spaces, and
        optionally including other notation. For example:
      </p>

<codeblock>
--ssl_cipher_list="RC4-SHA,RC4-MD5"
</codeblock>

      <p>
        See the output of <cmdname>man ciphers</cmdname> for the full set
        of keywords and notation allowed in the argument string.
        Since <keyword keyref="impala42"/> the default value of <codeph>--ssl_cipher_list</codeph>
        is a set of ciphers based on Mozilla's intermediate compatibility recommendations
        from https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS.
        Prior to <keyword keyref="impala42"/> the default was unset, and Impala used the default
        cipher list for the underlying platform.
