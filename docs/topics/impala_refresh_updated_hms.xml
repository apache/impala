  <p>
   As the name implies the query option <codeph>REFRESH_UPDATED_HMS_PARTITIONS</codeph> is used
   to refresh any updated HMS partitions.
  </p>

  <p>This option is disabled by default so that the performance is not compromised when refreshing a
   table. However, for certain corner case scenarios refresh table command does not detect changed
   partitions. In case of the default refresh, catalogd detects, adds any new partitions and removes
   any partitions which are not present in HMS anymore. However, it does not update any partitions
   that changed (eg. change of location). When this query option is enabled, the refresh table
   command will detect certain changes to the partitions and update them accordingly. Currently,
   catalogd will update the partitions if any of the following StorageDescriptor properties have
   been modified. 1. Partition Location 2. Partition Fileformat. 3 SerdeInfo. 4. Partition schema
   changes. 5. Partition bucketInfo.</p>

  <p>
   <b>Type:</b><codeph>BOOLEAN</codeph>; recognized values are 1 and 0, or true and false; any other
   value will be interpreted as false.
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Default:</b><codeph>FALSE</codeph> (shown as 0 in output of SET statement).
