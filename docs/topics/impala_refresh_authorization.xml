  <conbody>

    <p>
      The <codeph>REFRESH AUTHORIZATION</codeph> statement explicitly refreshes authorization
      data, including privileges and principals. When there is an external update to
      authorization metadata, use this statement to force Impala to refresh its authorization
      data without having to wait for the Ranger polling or run <codeph>INVALIDATE
      METADATA</codeph>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once issued, the <codeph>REFRESH AUTHORIZATION</codeph> statement cannot be cancelled.
    </p>

    <p>
      See <xref href="impala_authorization.xml#authorization">Impala Authorization</xref> for
      information on enabling and using authorization in Impala.

      <b>Syntax:</b>
    </p>

<codeblock>REFRESH AUTHORIZATION</codeblock>

    <p>
      <b>Usage notes:</b> If authorization is not enabled, Impala returns an error.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Added in:</b> Impala 3.2
