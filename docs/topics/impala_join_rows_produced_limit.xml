    <p>
      The <codeph>JOIN_ROWS_PRODUCED_LIMIT</codeph> query option limits the number of join
      rows produced by a join node and is used to prevent runaway join queries. A query
      is canceled when any one of the joins in the query produces more rows (totaled across
      all instances of that join) than the specified limit set by the
      <codeph>JOIN_ROWS_PRODUCED_LIMIT</codeph> option.
    </p>

    <p>
      This limit is checked periodically, so it is possible that the actual number of rows
      produced may be slightly higher than the limit.
    </p>

    <p>
      The default value of <codeph>0</codeph> specifies that there is no limit on the number of
      join rows produced.
