      <indexterm audience="hidden">DISABLE_ROW_RUNTIME_FILTERING query option</indexterm>
      The <codeph>DISABLE_ROW_RUNTIME_FILTERING</codeph> query option
      reduces the scope of the runtime filtering feature. Queries still dynamically prune
      partitions, but do not apply the filtering logic to individual rows within partitions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Only applies to queries against Parquet tables. For other file formats, Impala
      only prunes at the level of partitions, not individual rows.
    </p>

    <p>
      Impala automatically evaluates whether the per-row filters are being
      effective at reducing the amount of intermediate data. Therefore,
      this option is typically only needed for the rare case where Impala
      cannot accurately determine how effective the per-row filtering is
      for a query.
    </p>

    <p conref="../shared/impala_common.xml#common/runtime_filtering_option_caveat"/>

    <p>
      Because this setting only improves query performance in very specific
      circumstances, depending on the query characteristics and data distribution,
      only use it when you determine through benchmarking that it improves
      performance of specific expensive queries.
      Consider setting this query option immediately before the expensive query and
      unsetting it immediately afterward.

      When applied to a query involving a Kudu table, this option turns off
      all runtime filtering for the Kudu table.
