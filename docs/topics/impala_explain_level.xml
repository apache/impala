  <conbody>

    <p> Controls the amount of detail provided in the output of the
        <codeph>EXPLAIN</codeph> statement. The basic output can help you
      identify high-level performance issues such as scanning a higher volume of
      data or more partitions than you expect. The higher levels of detail show
      how intermediate results flow between nodes and how different SQL
      operations such as <codeph>ORDER BY</codeph>, <codeph>GROUP BY</codeph>,
      joins, and <codeph>WHERE</codeph> clauses are implemented within a
      distributed query. </p>

    <p>
      <b>Type:</b> <codeph>STRING</codeph> or <codeph>INT</codeph>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Default:</b> <codeph>1</codeph>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Arguments:</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      The allowed range of numeric values for this option is 0 to 3:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <codeph>0</codeph> or <codeph>MINIMAL</codeph>: A barebones list, one line per operation. Primarily useful
        for checking the join order in very long queries where the regular <codeph>EXPLAIN</codeph> output is too
        long to read easily.
      </li>

      <li>
        <codeph>1</codeph> or <codeph>STANDARD</codeph>: The default level of detail, showing the logical way that
        work is split up for the distributed query.
      </li>

      <li>
        <codeph>2</codeph> or <codeph>EXTENDED</codeph>: Includes additional
        detail about how the query planner uses statistics in its
        decision-making process, to understand how a query could be tuned by
        gathering statistics, using query hints, adding or removing predicates,
        and so on. In <keyword keyref="impala32_full"/> and higher, the output
        also includes the analyzed query with the cast information in the output
        header, and the implicit cast info in the Predicate section.</li>

      <li>
        <codeph>3</codeph> or <codeph>VERBOSE</codeph>: The maximum level of detail, showing how work is split up
        within each node into <q>query fragments</q> that are connected in a pipeline. This extra detail is
        primarily useful for low-level performance testing and tuning within Impala itself, rather than for
        rewriting the SQL code at the user level.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <note>
      Prior to Impala 1.3, the allowed argument range for <codeph>EXPLAIN_LEVEL</codeph> was 0 to 1: level 0 had
      the mnemonic <codeph>NORMAL</codeph>, and level 1 was <codeph>VERBOSE</codeph>. In Impala 1.3 and higher,
      <codeph>NORMAL</codeph> is not a valid mnemonic value, and <codeph>VERBOSE</codeph> still applies to the
      highest level of detail but now corresponds to level 3. You might need to adjust the values if you have any
      older <codeph>impala-shell</codeph> script files that set the <codeph>EXPLAIN_LEVEL</codeph> query option.
    </note>

    <p>
      Changing the value of this option controls the amount of detail in the output of the <codeph>EXPLAIN</codeph>
      statement. The extended information from level 2 or 3 is especially useful during performance tuning, when
      you need to confirm whether the work for the query is distributed the way you expect, particularly for the
      most resource-intensive operations such as join queries against large tables, queries against tables with
      large numbers of partitions, and insert operations for Parquet tables. The extended information also helps to
      check estimated resource usage when you use the admission control or resource management features explained
      in <xref href="impala_resource_management.xml#resource_management"/>. See
      <xref href="impala_explain.xml#explain"/> for the syntax of the <codeph>EXPLAIN</codeph> statement, and
      <xref href="impala_explain_plan.xml#perf_explain"/> for details about how to use the extended information.
    </p>

    <p conref="../shared/impala_common.xml#common/usage_notes_blurb"/>

    <p>
      As always, read the <codeph>EXPLAIN</codeph> output from bottom to top. The lowest lines represent the
      initial work of the query (scanning data files), the lines in the middle represent calculations done on each
      node and how intermediate results are transmitted from one node to another, and the topmost lines represent
      the final results being sent back to the coordinator node.
    </p>

    <p>
      The numbers in the left column are generated internally during the initial planning phase and do not
      represent the actual order of operations, so it is not significant if they appear out of order in the
      <codeph>EXPLAIN</codeph> output.
    </p>

    <p>
      At all <codeph>EXPLAIN</codeph> levels, the plan contains a warning if any tables in the query are missing
      statistics. Use the <codeph>COMPUTE STATS</codeph> statement to gather statistics for each table and suppress
      this warning. See <xref href="impala_perf_stats.xml#perf_stats"/> for details about how the statistics help
      query performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <codeph>PROFILE</codeph> command in <cmdname>impala-shell</cmdname> always starts with an explain plan
      showing full detail, the same as with <codeph>EXPLAIN_LEVEL=3</codeph>. <ph rev="1.4.0">After the explain
      plan comes the executive summary, the same output as produced by the <codeph>SUMMARY</codeph> command in
      <cmdname>impala-shell</cmdname>.</ph>
    </p>

    <p conref="../shared/impala_common.xml#common/example_blurb"/>

    <p>
      These examples use a trivial, empty table to illustrate how the essential aspects of query planning are shown
      in <codeph>EXPLAIN</codeph> output:

      join to a shuffle join.

    <p>
      For a join involving many different tables, the default <codeph>EXPLAIN</codeph> output might stretch over
      several pages, and the only details you care about might be the join order and the mechanism (broadcast or
      shuffle) for joining each pair of tables. In that case, you might set <codeph>EXPLAIN_LEVEL</codeph> to its
      lowest value of 0, to focus on just the join order and join mechanism for each stage. The following example
      shows how the rows from the first and second joined tables are hashed and divided among the nodes of the
      cluster for further filtering; then the entire contents of the third table are broadcast to all nodes for the
      final stage of join processing.
    </p>
