    <p>
      Sometimes, balancing raw query performance against scalability requires limiting the amount of resources,
      such as memory or CPU, used by a single query or group of queries. Impala can use several mechanisms that
      help to smooth out the load during heavy concurrent usage, resulting in faster overall query times and
      sharing of resources across Impala queries, MapReduce jobs, and other kinds of workloads across a CDH
      cluster:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The Impala admission control feature uses a fast, distributed mechanism to hold back queries that exceed
        limits on the number of concurrent queries or the amount of memory used. The queries are queued, and
        executed as other queries finish and resources become available. You can control the concurrency limits,
        and specify different limits for different groups of users to divide cluster resources according to the
        priorities of different classes of users. This feature is new in Impala 1.3, and works with both CDH 4 and
        CDH 5. See <xref href="impala_admission.xml#admission_control"/> for details.
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          You can restrict the amount of memory Impala reserves during query execution by specifying the
          <codeph>-mem_limit</codeph> option for the <codeph>impalad</codeph> daemon. See
          <xref href="impala_config_options.xml#config_options"/> for details. This limit applies only to the
          memory that is directly consumed by queries; Impala reserves additional memory at startup, for example to
          hold cached metadata.
        </p>
      </li>

        <p>
          For production deployment, <ph rev="upstream">Cloudera</ph> recommends that you implement resource isolation using mechanisms
          such as cgroups, which you can configure using Cloudera Manager. For details, see the
          <xref href="http://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_mc_service_pools.html" scope="external" format="html">Static
          Resource Pools</xref> in the Cloudera Manager documentation.
