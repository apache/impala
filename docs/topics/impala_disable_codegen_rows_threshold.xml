    <p rev="2.0.0"> This setting controls the cutoff point (in terms of number
      of rows processed per Impala daemon) below which Impala disables native
      code generation for the whole query. Native code generation is very
      beneficial for queries that process many rows because it reduces the time
      taken to process of each row. However, generating the native code adds
      latency to query startup. Therefore, automatically disabling codegen for
      queries that process relatively small amounts of data can improve query
      response time. </p>

    <p conref="../shared/impala_common.xml#common/syntax_blurb"/>

<codeblock>SET DISABLE_CODEGEN_ROWS_THRESHOLD=<varname>number_of_rows</varname></codeblock>

    <p>
      <b>Type:</b> numeric
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Default:</b> 50000
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Usage notes:</b> Typically, you increase the default value to make this optimization apply to more queries.
      If incorrect or corrupted table and column statistics cause Impala to apply this optimization incorrectly to
      queries that actually involve substantial work, you might see the queries being slower as a result of codegen
      being disabled. In that case, recompute statistics with the <codeph>COMPUTE STATS</codeph> or
      <codeph>COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS</codeph> statement. If there is a problem collecting accurate statistics,
      you can turn this feature off by setting the value to 0.
    </p>

    <p conref="../shared/impala_common.xml#common/internals_blurb"/>

    <p>
      This setting applies to queries where the number of rows processed can be accurately
      determined, either through table and column statistics, or by the presence of a
      <codeph>LIMIT</codeph> clause. If Impala cannot accurately estimate the number of rows,
      then this setting does not apply.
    </p>

    <p rev="2.3.0">
      If a query uses the complex data types <codeph>STRUCT</codeph>, <codeph>ARRAY</codeph>,
      or <codeph>MAP</codeph>, then codegen is never automatically disabled regardless of the
      <codeph>DISABLE_CODEGEN_ROWS_THRESHOLD</codeph> setting.
