      <indexterm audience="hidden">RUNTIME_BLOOM_FILTER_SIZE query option</indexterm>
      Size (in bytes) of Bloom filter data structure used by the runtime filtering
      feature.

    <note type="important">
      <p rev="2.6.0 IMPALA-3007">
        In <keyword keyref="impala26_full"/> and higher, this query option only applies as a fallback, when statistics
        are not available. By default, Impala estimates the optimal size of the Bloom filter structure
        regardless of the setting for this option. (This is a change from the original behavior in
        <keyword keyref="impala25_full"/>.)
      </p>
      <p rev="2.6.0 IMPALA-3007">
        In <keyword keyref="impala26_full"/> and higher, when the value of this query option is used for query planning,
        it is constrained by the minimum and maximum sizes specified by the
        <codeph>RUNTIME_FILTER_MIN_SIZE</codeph> and <codeph>RUNTIME_FILTER_MAX_SIZE</codeph> query options.
        The filter size is adjusted upward or downward if necessary to fit within the minimum/maximum range.

      This setting affects optimizations for large and complex queries, such
      as dynamic partition pruning for partitioned tables, and join optimization
      for queries that join large tables.
      Larger filters are more effective at handling
      higher cardinality input sets, but consume more memory per filter.
      <!--
      See <xref href="impala_runtime_filtering.xml#runtime_filtering"/> for details about when to change
      the setting for this query option.
      -->
    </p>

    <p>
      If your query filters on high-cardinality columns (for example, millions of different values)
      and you do not get the expected speedup from the runtime filtering mechanism, consider
      doing some benchmarks with a higher value for <codeph>RUNTIME_BLOOM_FILTER_SIZE</codeph>.
      The extra memory devoted to the Bloom filter data structures can help make the filtering
      more accurate.
    </p>

    <p conref="../shared/impala_common.xml#common/runtime_filtering_option_caveat"/>

    <p>
      Because the effectiveness of this setting depends so much on query characteristics and data distribution,
      you typically only use it for specific queries that need some extra tuning, and the ideal value depends
      on the query. Consider setting this query option immediately before the expensive query and
      unsetting it immediately afterward.
