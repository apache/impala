      The MEM_LIMIT query option defines the maximum amount of memory a query can allocate on
      each node. The total memory that can be used by a query is the <codeph>MEM_LIMIT</codeph>
      times the number of nodes.
    </p>
  <p rev="">
      There are two levels of memory limit for Impala. The
      <codeph>&#8209;&#8209;mem_limit</codeph> startup option sets an overall limit for the
      <cmdname>impalad</cmdname> process (which handles multiple queries concurrently). That
      process memory limit can be expressed either as a percentage of RAM available to the
      process such as <codeph>&#8209;&#8209;mem_limit=70%</codeph> or as a fixed amount of
      memory, such as <codeph>100gb</codeph>. The memory available to the process is based on
      the host's physical memory and, since Impala 3.2, memory limits from Linux Control Groups.
      E.g. if an <cmdname>impalad</cmdname> process is running in a Docker container on a host
      with 100GB of memory, the memory available is 100GB or the Docker container's memory
      limit, whichever is less.
    </p>
  <p rev="">
      The <codeph>MEM_LIMIT</codeph> query option, which you set through
      <cmdname>impala-shell</cmdname> or the <codeph>SET</codeph> statement in a JDBC or ODBC
      application, applies to each individual query. The <codeph>MEM_LIMIT</codeph> query option
      is usually expressed as a fixed size such as <codeph>10gb</codeph>, and must always be
      less than the <cmdname>impalad</cmdname> memory limit.
    </p>
  <p rev="">
      If query processing approaches the specified memory limit on any node, either the
      per-query limit or the impalad limit, then the SQL operations will start to reduce
      their memory consumption, for example by writing the temporary data to disk (known as spilling to disk).
      The result is a query that completes successfully, rather than failing with an out-of-memory error.
      The tradeoff is decreased performance due to the extra disk I/O to write the temporary data and
      read it back in. The slowdown could potentially be significant. Thus, while this feature improves
      reliability, you should optimize your queries, system parameters, and hardware configuration to
      make this spilling a rare occurrence.
    </p>
  <p>
   <b>Type:</b> numeric
    </p>
  <p rev="">
   <b>Units:</b> A numeric argument represents memory size in bytes; you can also use a
      suffix of <codeph>m</codeph> or <codeph>mb</codeph> for megabytes, or more commonly
      <codeph>g</codeph> or <codeph>gb</codeph> for gigabytes. If you specify a value with
      unrecognized formats, subsequent queries fail with an error.
    </p>
  <p rev="">
   <b>Default:</b> 0 (unlimited)
    </p>
  <p conref="../shared/impala_common.xml#common/usage_notes_blurb"/>
  <p rev="">
      The <codeph>MEM_LIMIT</codeph> setting is primarily useful for production workloads.
      Impala's Admission Controller can be configured to automatically assign memory limits to
      queries and limit memory consumption of resource pools. See <xref href="impala_admission.xml#admission_concurrency"/>
      and <xref href="impala_admission.xml#admission_memory"/> for more information on configuring
      the resource usage through admission control.
    </p>
  <p rev="">
      Use the output of the <codeph>SUMMARY</codeph> command in <cmdname>impala-shell</cmdname>
      to get a report of memory used for each phase of your most heavyweight queries on each
      node, and then set a <codeph>MEM_LIMIT</codeph> somewhat higher than that. See
      <xref href="impala_explain_plan.xml#perf_summary"/> for usage information about the
      <codeph>SUMMARY</codeph> command.

      The following examples show how to set the <codeph>MEM_LIMIT</codeph> query option using a
      fixed number of bytes, or suffixes representing gigabytes or megabytes.

      The following examples show how unrecognized <codeph>MEM_LIMIT</codeph> values lead to
      errors for subsequent queries.

  <p rev="">
      The following examples shows the automatic query cancellation when the
      <codeph>MEM_LIMIT</codeph> value is exceeded on any host involved in the Impala query.
      First it runs a successful query and checks the largest amount of memory used on any node
      for any stage of the query. Then it sets an artificially low <codeph>MEM_LIMIT</codeph>
      setting so that the same query cannot run.

      <note>This is an advanced query option. Setting this query option is not recommended

      <p>The existing <codeph>MEM_LIMIT</codeph> query option applies to all impala coordinators and
