      Specifies the default size for a memory buffer used when the
      spill-to-disk mechanism is activated, for example for queries against
      a large table with no statistics, or large join operations.

    <p>
      This query option sets an upper bound on the size of the internal
      buffer size that can be used during spill-to-disk operations. The
      actual size of the buffer is chosen by the query planner.
    </p>
    <p>
      If overall query performance is limited by the time needed for spilling,
      consider increasing the <codeph>DEFAULT_SPILLABLE_BUFFER_SIZE</codeph> setting.
      Larger buffer sizes result in Impala issuing larger I/O requests to storage
      devices, which might result in higher throughput, particularly on rotational
      disks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tradeoff with a large value for this setting is increased memory usage during
      spill-to-disk operations. Reducing this value may reduce memory consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      To determine if the value for this setting is having an effect by capping the
      spillable buffer size, you can see the buffer size chosen by the query planner for
      a particular query. <codeph>EXPLAIN</codeph> the query while the setting
      <codeph>EXPLAIN_LEVEL=2</codeph> is in effect.
