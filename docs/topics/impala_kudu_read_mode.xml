    <p rev="3.1.0 IMPALA-6812">
      The <codeph>KUDU_READ_MODE</codeph> query option allows you to set a desired consistency
      level for scans of Kudu tables.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Type:</b> String
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Default:</b> <codeph>"DEFAULT"</codeph>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Added in:</b> <keyword keyref="impala31"/>
    </p>

    <p conref="../shared/impala_common.xml#common/usage_notes_blurb"/>

    <p>
      The following values are supported for the query option:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <codeph>"DEFAULT"</codeph>: The value of the startup flag,
            <codeph>&#8209;&#8209;kudu_read_mode</codeph>, is used. </li>

        <li>
          <codeph>"READ_LATEST"</codeph>: Commonly known as the Read Committed isolation mode,
          in this mode, Kudu provides no consistency guarantees for this mode, except that all
          returned rows were committed at some point.
        </li>

        <li>
          <codeph>"READ_AT_SNAPSHOT"</codeph>: Kudu will take a snapshot of the current state of
          the data and perform the scan over the snapshot, possibly after briefly waiting for
          ongoing writes to complete. This provides "Read Your Writes" consistency within a
          single Impala session, except in the case of a Kudu leader change. See the Kudu
          documentation for more details.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

  </conbody>
