      The <xref href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/breakpad/breakpad/" scope="external" format="html">breakpad</xref>
      project is an open-source framework for crash reporting.
      In <keyword keyref="impala26_full"/> and higher, Impala can use <codeph>breakpad</codeph> to record stack information and
      register values when any of the Impala-related daemons crash due to an error such as <codeph>SIGSEGV</codeph>
      or unhandled exceptions.
      The dump files are much smaller than traditional core dump files. The dump mechanism itself uses very little
      memory, which improves reliability if the crash occurs while the system is low on memory.
    </p>

    <note type="important">
      Because of the internal mechanisms involving Impala memory allocation and Linux
      signalling for out-of-memory (OOM) errors, if an Impala-related daemon experiences a
      crash due to an OOM condition, it does <i>not</i> generate a minidump for that error.

    <title>Enabling or Disabling Minidump Generation</title>
    <conbody>
      <p>
        By default, a minidump file is generated when an Impala-related daemon crashes.
        To turn off generation of the minidump files, change the
        <uicontrol>minidump_path</uicontrol> configuration setting of one or more Impala-related daemons
        to the empty string, and restart the corresponding services or daemons.

      <p rev="IMPALA-3677 CDH-43745">
        In <keyword keyref="impala27_full"/> and higher,
        you can send a <codeph>SIGUSR1</codeph> signal to any Impala-related daemon to write a
        Breakpad minidump. For advanced troubleshooting, you can now produce a minidump
        without triggering a crash.

  <concept id="breakpad_minidump_location" rev="IMPALA-3581">
    <title>Specifying the Location for Minidump Files</title>
    <conbody>
      <p>
        By default, all minidump files are written to the following location
        on the host where a crash occurs:
        <!-- Location stated in IMPALA-3581; overridden by different location from IMPALA-2686?
             <filepath><varname>log_directory</varname>/minidumps/<varname>daemon_name</varname></filepath> -->
         <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Clusters not managed by cluster management software:
              <filepath><varname>impala_log_dir</varname>/<varname>daemon_name</varname>/minidumps/<varname>daemon_name</varname></filepath>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        The minidump files for <cmdname>impalad</cmdname>, <cmdname>catalogd</cmdname>,
        and <cmdname>statestored</cmdname> are each written to a separate directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        To specify a different location, set the
        <!-- Again, IMPALA-3581 says one thing and IMPALA-2686 / observation of CM interface says another.
             <codeph>log_dir</codeph> -->
        <uicontrol>minidump_path</uicontrol>
        configuration setting of one or more Impala-related daemons, and restart the corresponding services or daemons.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you specify a relative path for this setting, the value is interpreted relative to
        the default <uicontrol>minidump_path</uicontrol> directory.

  <concept id="breakpad_minidump_number">
    <title>Controlling the Number of Minidump Files</title>
    <conbody>
      <p>
        Like any files used for logging or troubleshooting, consider limiting the number of
        minidump files, or removing unneeded ones, depending on the amount of free storage
        space on the hosts in the cluster.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the minidump files are only used for problem resolution, you can remove any such files that
        are not needed to debug current issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        To control how many minidump files Impala keeps around at any one time,
        set the <uicontrol>max_minidumps</uicontrol> configuration setting for
        of one or more Impala-related daemon, and restart the corresponding services or daemons.
        The default for this setting is 9. A zero or negative value is interpreted as
        <q>unlimited</q>.

  <concept id="breakpad_minidump_logging">
    <title>Detecting Crash Events</title>
    <conbody>
      
      <p>
        You can see in the Impala log files when crash events occur that generate 
        minidump files. Because each restart begins a new log file, the <q>crashed</q> message 
        is always at or near the bottom of the log file. There might be another later message 
        if core dumps are also enabled.
      </p>
      
      <p audience="hidden">
        You can see in the Impala log files or in the Cloudera Manager charts for Impala
        when crash events occur that generate minidump files. Because each restart begins
        a new log file, the <q>crashed</q> message is always at or near the bottom of the

    <title>Using the Minidump Files for Problem Resolution</title>
    <conbody>
      <p>
        Typically, you provide minidump files to <keyword keyref="support_org"/> as part of problem resolution,
        in the same way that you might provide a core dump. The <uicontrol>Send Diagnostic Data</uicontrol>
        under the <uicontrol>Support</uicontrol> menu in Cloudera Manager guides you through the
        process of selecting a time period and volume of diagnostic data, then collects the data
        from all hosts and transmits the relevant information for you.
      </p>
      <fig id="fig_pqw_gvx_pr">
        <title>Send Diagnostic Data choice under Support menu</title>
        <image href="../images/support_send_diagnostic_data.png" scalefit="yes" placement="break"/>
      </fig>
      <p>
        You might get additional instructions from <keyword keyref="support_org"/> about collecting minidumps to better isolate a specific problem.
        Because the information in the minidump files is limited to stack traces and register contents,
        the possibility of including sensitive information is much lower than with core dump files.
        If any sensitive information is included in the minidump, <keyword keyref="support_org"/> preserves the confidentiality of that information.
