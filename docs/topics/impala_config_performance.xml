      This section describes the mandatory and recommended configuration settings for Impala. If Impala is
      installed using Cloudera Manager, some of these configurations are completed automatically; you must still
      configure short-circuit reads manually. If you installed Impala without Cloudera Manager, or if you want to
      customize your environment, consider making the changes described in this topic.
    </p>

    <p>
<!-- Could conref this paragraph from ciiu_install.xml. -->
      In some cases, depending on the level of Impala, CDH, and Cloudera Manager, you might need to add particular
      component configuration details in one of the free-form fields on the Impala configuration pages within
      Cloudera Manager. <ph conref="../shared/impala_common.xml#common/safety_valve"/>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        You must enable short-circuit reads, whether or not Impala was installed through Cloudera Manager. This
        setting goes in the Impala configuration settings, not the Hadoop-wide settings.
      </li>

      <li>
        If you installed Impala in an environment that is not managed by Cloudera Manager, you must enable block
        location tracking, and you can optionally enable native checksumming for optimal performance.
      </li>

      <li>
        If you deployed Impala using Cloudera Manager see
        <xref href="impala_perf_testing.xml#performance_testing"/> to confirm proper configuration.

      <title>Mandatory: Short-Circuit Reads</title>
      <p> Enabling short-circuit reads allows Impala to read local data directly
        from the file system. This removes the need to communicate through the
        DataNodes, improving performance. This setting also minimizes the number
        of additional copies of data. Short-circuit reads requires

        installed from a tarball. You must install from an
        <codeph>.rpm</codeph>, <codeph>.deb</codeph>, or parcel to use
        short-circuit local reads. <note> If you use Cloudera Manager, you can
          enable short-circuit reads through a checkbox in the user interface
          and that setting takes effect for Impala as well. </note>

      <title>Optional: Native Checksumming</title>

      <p>
        Enabling native checksumming causes Impala to use an optimized native library for computing checksums, if
        that library is available.
      </p>

      <p id="p_29">
        <b>To enable native checksumming:</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        If you installed CDH from packages, the native checksumming library is installed and setup correctly. In
        such a case, no additional steps are required. Conversely, if you installed by other means, such as with
        tarballs, native checksumming may not be available due to missing shared objects. Finding the message
        "<codeph>Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where
        applicable</codeph>" in the Impala logs indicates native checksumming may be unavailable. To enable native
        checksumming, you must build and install <codeph>libhadoop.so</codeph> (the
        <!-- Another instance of stale link. -->
