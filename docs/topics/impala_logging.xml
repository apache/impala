    <p> The Impala logs record information about: </p>

    <ul>
      <li> Any errors Impala encountered. If Impala experienced a serious error during startup, you
        must diagnose and troubleshoot that problem before you can do anything further with Impala. </li>

      <li> How Impala is configured. </li>

      <li> Jobs Impala has completed. </li>
    </ul>

    <note>
      <p> Formerly, the logs contained the query profile for each query, showing low-level details
        of how the work is distributed among nodes and how intermediate and final results are
        transmitted across the network. To save space, those query profiles are now stored in
        zlib-compressed files in <filepath>/var/log/impala/profiles</filepath>. You can access them
        through the Impala web user interface. For example, at
            <codeph>http://<varname>impalad-node-hostname</varname>:25000/queries</codeph>, each
        query is followed by a <codeph>Profile</codeph> link leading to a page showing extensive
        analytical data for the query execution. </p>
      <p rev="1.1.1"> The auditing feature introduced in Impala 1.1.1 produces a separate set of
        audit log files when enabled. See <xref href="impala_auditing.xml#auditing"/> for details. </p>

        <li> Examine the <codeph>.ERROR</codeph> and/or <codeph>.FATAL</codeph> files to see only
          the most serious errors, if the processes crash, or queries fail to complete. These
          messages are also in the <codeph>.WARNING</codeph> file. </li>

        <li> A new set of log files is produced each time the associated daemon is restarted. These
          log files have long names including a timestamp. The <codeph>.INFO</codeph>,

        <li> The <codeph>&#8209;&#8209;logbuflevel</codeph> startup flag for the
            <cmdname>impalad</cmdname> daemon specifies how often the log information is written to
          disk. The default is 0, meaning that the log is immediately flushed to disk when Impala
          outputs an important messages such as a warning or an error, but less important messages
          such as informational ones are buffered in memory rather than being flushed to disk
          immediately. </li>

    <conbody>

      <p> Impala periodically switches the physical files representing the current log files, after
        which it is safe to remove the old files if they are no longer needed. </p>

      <p> Impala can automatically remove older unneeded log files, a feature known as <term>log
          rotation</term>. </p>

      <p> In Impala 2.2 and higher, the <codeph>&#8209;&#8209;max_log_files</codeph> configuration
        option specifies how many log files to keep at each severity level (<codeph>INFO</codeph>,
          <codeph>WARNING</codeph>, <codeph>ERROR</codeph>, and <codeph>FATAL</codeph>). You can
        specify an appropriate setting for each Impala-related daemon (<cmdname>impalad</cmdname>,
          <cmdname>statestored</cmdname>, and <cmdname>catalogd</cmdname>). <ul>
          <li> A value of 0 preserves all log files, in which case you would set up set up manual
            log rotation using your Linux tool or technique of choice. </li>

          <li> A value of 1 preserves only the very latest log file. </li>

          <li> The default value is 10. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p> Impala checks to see if any old logs need to be removed based on the interval specified in
        the <codeph>&#8209;&#8209;logbufsecs</codeph> setting, every 5 seconds by default. </p>

      <p> For some log levels, Impala logs are first temporarily buffered in memory and only written
        to disk periodically. The <codeph>&#8209;&#8209;logbufsecs</codeph> setting controls the
        maximum time that log messages are buffered for. For example, with the default value of 5
        seconds, there may be up to a 5 second delay before a logged message shows up in the log
        file. </p>

      <p> It is not recommended that you set <codeph>&#8209;&#8209;logbufsecs</codeph> to 0 as the
        setting makes the Impala daemon to spin in the thread that tries to delete old log files. </p>

    <title>Changing Log Levels Dynamically</title>
    <conbody>
      <p>For debugging purposes you may be adjusting the logging configuration for Catalog and
        impalad servers. This required restarting the services. Impala supports adjusting the log
        levels dynamically without the need to restart the server. There is a
          <codeph>/log_level</codeph> tab in the debug page of all Impala servers. You can query the
          <codeph>log4j</codeph> log level of <codeph>root</codeph> or
          <codeph>org.apache.impala</codeph> by using the <codeph>Get Java Log Level</codeph>
        button. Also you can change the <codeph>vlog/log4j</codeph> levels to any supported levels
        of logging. You can select the log level using the <codeph>LOG LEVEL</codeph> drop down box.
        You also have an option to restore the log levels to their original configuration by using
        the <codeph>RESET</codeph> button.</p>

    <title>Reviewing Impala Logs</title>

    <conbody>

      <p> By default, the Impala log is stored at <codeph>/var/log/impalad/</codeph>. The most
        comprehensive log, showing informational, warning, and error messages, is in the file name
          <filepath>impalad.INFO</filepath>. View log file contents by using the web interface or by
        examining the contents of the log file. (When you examine the logs through the file system,
        you can troubleshoot problems by reading the <filepath>impalad.WARNING</filepath> and/or
          <filepath>impalad.ERROR</filepath> files, which contain the subsets of messages indicating
        potential problems.) </p>

      <note>
        <p> The web interface limits the amount of logging information displayed. To view every log
          entry, access the log files directly through the file system. </p>
      </note>

      <p> You can view the contents of the <codeph>impalad.INFO</codeph> log file in the file

    <title>Setting Logging Levels</title>

    <conbody>

      <p> Impala uses the GLOG system, which supports three logging levels. You can adjust logging
        levels by exporting variable settings. To change logging settings manually, use a command
        similar to the following on each node before starting <codeph>impalad</codeph>: </p>

      <codeblock>export GLOG_v=1</codeblock>

      <note> For performance reasons, do not enable the most verbose logging level of 3 unless there
        is no other alternative for troubleshooting. </note>

      <p> For more information on how to configure GLOG, including how to set variable logging
        levels for different system components, see <xref keyref="glog.html">documentation for the
          glog project on github</xref>. </p>

      <section id="loglevels_details">
        <title>Understanding What is Logged at Different Logging Levels</title>
        <p> As logging levels increase, the categories of information logged are cumulative. For
          example, GLOG_v=2 records everything GLOG_v=1 records, as well as additional information. </p>
        <p> Increasing logging levels imposes performance overhead and increases log size. Where
          practical, use GLOG_v=1 for most cases: this level has minimal performance impact but
          still captures useful troubleshooting information. </p>
        <p> Additional information logged at each level is as follows: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> GLOG_v=1 - The default level. Logs information about each connection and query that
            is initiated to an <codeph>impalad</codeph> instance, including runtime profiles. </li>

          <li> GLOG_v=2 - Everything from the previous level plus information for each RPC
            initiated. This level also records query execution progress information, including
            details on each file that is read. </li>

          <li> GLOG_v=3 - Everything from the previous level plus logging of every row that is read.
            This level is only applicable for the most serious troubleshooting and tuning scenarios,
            because it can produce exceptionally large and detailed log files, potentially leading
            to its own set of performance and capacity problems. </li>

    <conbody>

      <p>
        <term>Log redaction</term> is a security feature that prevents sensitive information from
        being displayed in locations used by administrators for monitoring and troubleshooting, such
        as log files and the Impala debug web user interface. You configure regular expressions that
        match sensitive types of information processed by your system, such as credit card numbers
        or tax IDs, and literals matching these patterns are obfuscated wherever they would normally
        be recorded in log files or displayed in administration or debugging user interfaces. </p>

      <p> In a security context, the log redaction feature is complementary to the Ranger
        authorization framework. Ranger prevents unauthorized users from being able to directly
        access table data. Redaction prevents administrators or support personnel from seeing the
        smaller amounts of sensitive or personally identifying information (PII) that might appear
        in queries issued by those authorized users. </p>
