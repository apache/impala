  <conbody>
    <p rev="2.3.0"> When the <codeph>LIVE_SUMMARY</codeph> query option is set
      to <codeph>TRUE</codeph>, Impala displays the same output as the
        <codeph>SUMMARY</codeph> command for queries submitted through the
        <cmdname>impala-shell</cmdname> command, with the measurements updated
      in real time as the query progresses. When the query finishes, the final
        <codeph>SUMMARY</codeph> output remains visible in the
        <cmdname>impala-shell</cmdname> console output. </p>
    <p>Starting in <keyword keyref="impala31"/>, the summary output also
      includes the queuing status consisting of whether the query was queued and
      what was the latest queuing reason.</p>
    <p><b>Type:</b>
      <codeph>Boolean</codeph></p>
    <p><b>Default:</b>
      <codeph>FALSE (0)</codeph></p>
    <p conref="../shared/impala_common.xml#common/command_line_blurb"/>
    <p> You can enable this query option within <cmdname>impala-shell</cmdname>
      by starting the shell with the <codeph>--live_summary</codeph>
      command-line option. You can still turn this setting off and on again
      within the shell through the <codeph>SET</codeph> command. </p>
    <p conref="../shared/impala_common.xml#common/usage_notes_blurb"/>
    <p> The live summary output can be useful for evaluating long-running
      queries, to evaluate which phase of execution takes up the most time, or
      if some hosts take much longer than others for certain operations,
      dragging overall performance down. By making the information available in
      real time, this feature lets you decide what action to take even before
      you cancel a query that is taking much longer than normal. </p>
    <p> For example, you might see the HDFS scan phase taking a long time, and
      therefore revisit performance-related aspects of your schema design such
      as constructing a partitioned table, switching to the Parquet file format,
      running the <codeph>COMPUTE STATS</codeph> statement for the table, and so
      on. Or you might see a wide variation between the average and maximum
      times for all hosts to perform some phase of the query, and therefore
      investigate if one particular host needed more memory or was experiencing
      a network problem. </p>
