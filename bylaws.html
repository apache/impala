    <h1>Apache Impala (incubating) Project Bylaws</h1><a name="N1000D"></a><a name=
    "Introduction"></a>

    <h2 class="h3">Introduction</h2>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This document defines the bylaws under which the Apache Impala (incubating)
      project operates. It defines the roles and responsibilities of the project, who may
      vote, how voting works, how conflicts are resolved, etc.</p>

      <p>Impala is a project of the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/">Apache
      Software Foundation</a>. The foundation holds the trademark on the name "Impala"
      and copyright on Apache code including the code in the Impala codebase. The
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html">foundation FAQ</a> explains the
      operation and background of the foundation.</p>

      <p>Impala is typical of Apache projects in that it operates under a set of
      principles, known collectively as the "Apache Way". If you are new to Apache
      development, please refer to the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org">Incubator
      project</a> for more information on how Apache projects operate.</p>
    </div><a name="N10028"></a><a name="Roles+and+Responsibilities"></a>

    <h2 class="h3">Roles and Responsibilities</h2>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Apache projects define a set of roles with associated rights and
      responsibilities. These roles govern what tasks an individual may perform within
      the project. The roles are defined in the following sections</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Users</strong>

          <p>The most important participants in the project are people who use our
          software.</p>

          <p>Users contribute to the Apache projects by providing feedback to developers
          in the form of bug reports and feature suggestions. As well, users participate
          in the Apache community by helping other users on mailing lists and user
          support forums.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Contributors</strong>

          <p>All of the volunteers who are contributing time, code, documentation, or
          resources to the Impala Project. A contributor that makes sustained, welcome
          contributions to the project may be invited to become a Committer, though the
          exact timing of such invitations depends on many factors.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Committers</strong>

          <p>The project's Committers are responsible for the project's technical
          management. Committers have write access to the project's version control
          repositories. Committers may cast binding votes on any technical
          discussion.</p>

          <p>Committer access is by invitation only and must be approved by consensus
          approval of the active PMC members. A Committer is considered emeritus by their
          own declaration or by not contributing in any form to the project for over six
          months. An emeritus committer may request reinstatement of commit access from
          the PMC. Such reinstatement is subject to consensus approval of active PMC
          members.</p>

          <p>Significant, pervasive features may be developed in a speculative branch of
          the repository. The PMC may grant commit rights on the branch to its consistent
          contributors for the duration of the initiative. Branch committers are
          responsible for shepherding their feature into an active release and do not
          cast binding votes or vetoes in the project.</p>

          <p>All Apache committers are required to have a signed Contributor License
          Agreement (CLA) on file with the Apache Software Foundation. There is a
          <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html">Committer FAQ</a> which
          provides more details on the requirements for Committers</p>

          <p>A committer who makes a sustained contribution to the project may be invited
          to become a member of the PMC. The form of contribution is not limited to code.
          It can also include code review, helping out users on the mailing lists,
          documentation, testing, etc.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Release Manager</strong>

          <p>A Release Manager (RM) is a committer who volunteers to produce a Release
          Candidate according to <a href=
          "https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToRelease">HowToRelease</a>. The RM shall
          publish a Release Plan on the <em>dev@</em> list stating the branch from which
          they intend to make a Release Candidate, at least one week before they do so.
          The RM is responsible for building consensus around the content of the Release
          Candidate, in order to achieve a successful Product Release vote.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Project Management Committee</strong>

          <p>The Project Management Committee (PMC) is responsible to the board and the
          ASF for the management and oversight of the Apache Impala codebase. The
          responsibilities of the PMC include</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Deciding what is distributed as products of the Apache Impala project. In
            particular all releases must be approved by the PMC</li>

            <li>Maintaining the project's shared resources, including the codebase
            repository, mailing lists, and websites.</li>

            <li>Speaking on behalf of the project.</li>

            <li>Resolving license disputes regarding products of the project</li>

            <li>Nominating new PMC members and committers</li>

            <li>Maintaining these bylaws and other guidelines of the project</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Membership of the PMC is by invitation only and must be approved by a
          consensus approval of active PMC members. A PMC member is considered "emeritus"
          by their own declaration or by not contributing in any form to the project for
          over six months. An emeritus member may request reinstatement to the PMC. Such
          reinstatement is subject to consensus approval of the active PMC members.</p>

          <p>The chair of the PMC is appointed by the ASF board. The chair is an office
          holder of the Apache Software Foundation (Vice President, Apache Impala) and
          has primary responsibility to the board for the management of the projects
          within the scope of the Impala PMC. The chair reports to the board quarterly on
          developments within the Impala project.</p>

          <p>The chair of the PMC is rotated annually. When the chair is rotated or if
          the current chair of the PMC resigns, the PMC votes to recommend a new chair
          using Single Transferable Vote (STV) voting. See <a href=
          "http://wiki.apache.org/general/BoardVoting">BoardVoting</a> for specifics. The
          decision must be ratified by the Apache board.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div><a name="N10094"></a><a name="Decision+Making"></a>

    <h2 class="h3">Decision Making</h2>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Within the Impala project, different types of decisions require different forms
      of approval. For example, the <a href="#Roles+and+Responsibilities">previous
      section</a> describes several decisions which require "consensus approval"
      approval. This section defines how voting is performed, the types of approvals, and
      which types of decision require which type of approval.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Voting</strong>

          <p>Decisions regarding the project are made by votes on the primary project
          development mailing list (dev@impala.incubator.apache.org). Where necessary, PMC
          voting may take place on the private Impala PMC mailing list. Votes are clearly
          indicated by subject line starting with [VOTE]. Votes may contain multiple
          items for approval and these should be clearly separated. Voting is carried out
          by replying to the vote mail. Voting may take four flavors</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>+1</strong> "Yes," "Agree," or "the action should be performed."
            In general, this vote also indicates a willingness on the behalf of the voter
            in "making it happen"</li>

            <li><strong>+0</strong> This vote indicates a willingness for the action
            under consideration to go ahead. The voter, however will not be able to
            help.</li>

            <li><strong>-0</strong> This vote indicates that the voter does not, in
            general, agree with the proposed action but is not concerned enough to
            prevent the action going ahead.</li>

            <li><strong>-1</strong> This is a negative vote. On issues where consensus is
            required, this vote counts as a <strong>veto</strong>. All vetoes must
            contain an explanation of why the veto is appropriate. Vetoes with no
            explanation are void. It may also be appropriate for a -1 vote to include an
            alternative course of action.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Patches are reviewed in the code review tool, where the vote flavors are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>+2</strong> "I am confident in the change and this can be
            committed without further review after addressing the remaining points I have
            made."</li>

            <li><strong>+1</strong> "I am OK with this being committed after the remaining
            points in my comment have been addressed and someone else votes +2."</li>

            <li><strong>-1</strong> "I oppose this being committed."</li>
          </ul>

          <p>All participants in the Impala project are encouraged to show their
          agreement with or against a particular action by voting. For technical
          decisions, only the votes of active committers are binding. Non binding votes
          are still useful for those with binding votes to understand the perception of
          an action in the wider Impala community. For PMC decisions, only the votes of
          PMC members are binding.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Approvals</strong>

          <p>These are the types of approvals that can be sought. Different actions
          require different types of approvals</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Consensus Approval -</strong> Consensus approval requires 3
            binding +1 votes and no binding vetoes.</li>

            <li><strong>Lazy Consensus -</strong> Lazy consensus requires no -1 votes
            ('silence gives assent').</li>

            <li><strong>Lazy Majority -</strong> A lazy majority vote requires 3 binding
            +1 votes and more binding +1 votes than -1 votes.</li>

            <li><strong>Lazy 2/3 Majority -</strong> Lazy 2/3 majority votes requires at
            least 3 votes and twice as many +1 votes as -1 votes.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Vetoes</strong>

          <p>A valid, binding veto cannot be overruled. If a veto is cast, it must be
          accompanied by a valid reason explaining the reasons for the veto. The validity
          of a veto, if challenged, can be confirmed by anyone who has a binding vote.
          This does not necessarily signify agreement with the veto - merely that the
          veto is valid.</p>

          <p>If you disagree with a valid veto, you must lobby the person casting the
          veto to withdraw their veto. If a veto is not withdrawn, any action that has
          been vetoed must be reversed in a timely manner.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Actions</strong>

          <p>This section describes the various actions which are undertaken within the
          project, the corresponding approval required for that action and those who have
          binding votes over the action.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Code Change</strong>

              <p>A change made to a codebase of the project and committed by a committer.
              This includes source code, documentation, website content, etc.</p>

              <p>At least one +2 from a committer and no -1 from any committer.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Product Release</strong>

              <p>When a release of one of the project's products is ready, a vote is
              required to accept the release as an official release of the project.</p>

              <p>Lazy Majority of active PMC members</p>
            </li>

            <li>

    <p>Apache Impala is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation
    (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly
    accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure,
    communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent
    with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a
    reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the
    project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p>
