<h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
<p>Cloudera Impala is a modern, open-source MPP SQL engine architected from the ground up for the
Hadoop data processing environment. Impala provides low latency and high concurrency for BI/analytic
read-mostly queries on Hadoop, not delivered by batch frameworks such as Apache Hive. This paper
presents Impala from a userâ€™s perspective, gives an overview of its architecture and main components
and briefly demonstrates its superior performance compared against other popular SQL-on-Hadoop
systems.</p>
