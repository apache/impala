<p>This document discusses nested data types in Impala, including structs, maps, and arrays. It
provides an example schema using these types, describes Impala's SQL syntax extensions for querying
nested data, and discusses techniques for advanced querying capabilities like correlated subqueries.
The execution model materializes minimal nested structures in memory and uses new execution nodes to
handle nested data types.</p>
