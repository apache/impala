<p>Impala has proven to be a high-performance analytics query engine since the beginning. Even as an
initial production release in 2013, it demonstrated performance 2x faster than a traditional DBMS,
and each subsequent release has continued to demonstrate the wide performance gap between Impalaâ€™s
analytic-database architecture and SQL-on-Apache Hadoop alternatives. Today, we are excited to
continue that track record via some important performance gains for Impala 2.5 (with more to come on
the roadmap), summarized below.</p>

<p>Overall, compared to Impala 2.3, in Impala 2.5:</p>

<ul>
  <li>TPC-DS queries run on average 4.3x faster.</li>
  <li>TPC-H queries run 2.2x faster on flat tables, and 1.71x faster on nested tables.</li>
</ul>
