# Apache Impala (incubating): Blog Quickstart

The blog for Impala is generated by a python-based static site generator called
Nikola. (This was chosen over another well-known tool, Jekyll, which is
Ruby-based.)

## Setting Up the Nikola Environment

### Getting the Impala ASF web site source files

The web site is on the ```asf-site``` branch of the ASF Impala repo.

```
$ git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-impala.git impala_website --branch asf-site --single-branch
```

### Installing the required python packages into a virtualenv

You will need to install a few python packages to work with Nikola. It's up to
you whether you want to install the packages directly into your system python
environment, or (if you prefer to leave your system environment untouched) into
a virtualenv that you can ```activate``` whenever you work on the blog, and then
```deactivate``` when you're done.

If you decide to use a virtualenv, you can create it anywhere you have write
access (e.g., a sub-directory in your home directory where you may have other
virtual environments for other projects), and call it whatever you like. In our
example, we're simply calling it ```blog_env```.

Use the ```virtualenv``` command to create the virtual environment. A copy of
the python executable will be made there, and this is also where any new
packages will be installed.

```
$ virtualenv ~/my_virtualenvs/blog_env
New python executable in /home/username/my_virtualenvs/blog_env
Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.
```

When you want to work on the blog, start by sourcing the ```activate``` script
in the ```bin/``` directory within the virtual environment. Once the environment
is active, you should see its name added at the beginning of your shell's prompt.
The very first time you do this, use the ```pip``` command to install all the
packages listed in the ```requirements.txt``` file.

```
$ source ~/my_virtualenvs/blog_env/bin/activate
(blog_env) $ cd impala_website/nikola_site_generator
(blog_env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you decide to forego setting up a ```virtualenv```, and just plan to install
the required libraries into your system python, you can just simply run the
```pip``` command, but will probably need to use ```sudo```.

## Adding content

### Writing the article

Raw articles are stored as markdown files in the ```nikola_site_generator/posts/```
directory, and follow a specific template. Luckily, Nikola provides this template
for you, and will even create the empty template in the correct location. (You
should probably do this on a new working branch in the repo.)

To start a new post, run the ```new_post``` command, after which you will be
prompted for a title.

```
$ nikola new_post
Creating New Post

Title: My New Post
Scanning posts........done!
[2017-01-10T19:54:32Z] INFO: new_post: Your post's text is at: posts/my-new-post.md
```

You shoud have an empty dated template now that you can fill in. Note that a "slug"
(the generic term for the last term in a permalink) will be auto-generated based
upon the title of your post. You can feel free to shorten or edit this as you
see fit.

```html
$ cat posts/my-new-post.md
<!--

Note the special ```TEASER_END``` tag after this first paragraph. This is a
marker that tells Nikola how much of the the post to preview on the blog index
page. If no ```TEASER_END``` is specified, the entire post will be visible.

### Generating the HTML files

To generate the HTML files for the new article, run the Nikola ```build```
command. Your new post will be generated, along with any files that may link
to it.

```
(blog_env) $ nikola build
Scanning posts........done!
.  render_posts:timeline_changes
.  render_posts:cache/posts/my-new-post.html
.  render_sources:../blog/posts/my-new-post/index.md
.  render_archive:../blog/2017/index.html
.  render_archive:../blog/archive.html
.  render_indexes:../blog/index.html
.  render_pages:../blog/posts/impala-blog-coming-soon/index.html
.  render_pages:../blog/posts/my-new-post/index.html
.  sitemap:../blog/sitemap.xml
.  sitemap:../blog/sitemapindex.xml
```

### Uploading the new files

```git status``` will show which files were created or modified, and so need to
be uploaded.

```
(blog_env) $ git status
On branch nikola_site
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

  modified:   ../blog/2017/index.html
  modified:   ../blog/archive.html
  modified:   ../blog/index.html
  modified:   ../blog/posts/impala-blog-coming-soon/index.html
  modified:   ../blog/sitemap.xml
  modified:   ../blog/sitemapindex.xml

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

  ../blog/posts/my-new-post/
  posts/my-new-post.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

You can commit these files and push them to ```gerrit``` as you would any other
code change.


### Viewing your changes

Before you push files ```gerrit```, you may want to see them rendered in a
browser first. Nikola includes a basic web server.

```
(blog_env) $ nikola serve --browser  # The default port is 8000
```

This will open a browser and automatically load the page at ```0.0.0.0:8000```.

Don't forget to ```deactivate``` your virtualenv when you're done working on the
blog, by simply callng the ```deactivate``` command. This will return you to your
system python environment.

```
(blog_env) $ deactivate
$
```
