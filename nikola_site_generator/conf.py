#
# From those files, a set of HTML fragment files will be generated:

# This is a dictionary of lists. Each key in the dictionary is the

# Folders containing images to be used in normal posts or pages.
# IMAGE_FOLDERS is a dictionary of the form {"source": "destination"},

# to the site. Thumbnail images will be created there as well.

# To reference the images in your posts, include a leading slash in the path.
# For example, if IMAGE_FOLDERS = {'images': 'images'}, write
#
#   ..image:: /images/tesla.jpg
#
# See the Nikola Handbook for details (in the “Embedding Images” and
# “Thumbnails” sections)
