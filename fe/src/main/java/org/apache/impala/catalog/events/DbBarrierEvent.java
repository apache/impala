/**
 * An instance of this class is used to synchronize all the TableProcessors to process
 * a database event. It holds the reference to database event.
 * <p>
 * On a DbProcessor's event processing, when a database event is seen at head end of
 * input event queue, a new instance of this class is created, added to the event queue
 * of all the TableProcessors(belonging to the database) and also to DB event queue of
 * the DbProcessor. It acts as a barrier to restrict the processing of table events that
 * occurred later than the database event, till the database event is processed on
 * DbProcessor.
 * <p>
 * When a TableProcessor's event processing reaches the DbBarrierEvent, it
 * indicates that to DbProcessor event processing with {@link DbBarrierEvent#proceed()}
 * and do not process any further events beyond it. On subsequent event processing
 * schedules, TableProcessor's event processing determines whether database event is
 * processed on DbProcessor with {@link DbBarrierEvent#isAllDerivedEventsProcessed()}.
 * <p>
 * Once all the TableProcessors indicate DbProcessor event processing, DbProcessor
 * process the DbBarrierEvent and marks it as processed. And the TableProcessors detects
 * the event status with {@link DbBarrierEvent#isAllDerivedEventsProcessed()}. Henceforth,
 * all the TableProcessors continue to process their table events independently.
