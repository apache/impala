# This is a script that allows a tester to test his Oracle setup and cx_Oracle
# installation within his impala-python3 environment. It's meant to be super simple.  The
# emphasis here is on a cx_Oracle connection and cursor with no other distractions, even
# command line option parsing/handling. Modify the constants below and run:
#
#  $ ./verify-oracle-connection.py
#
# If you get an exception, something is wrong. If cx_Oracle was able to make a
# connection to Oracle and run a simple query, you'll get a success message.
#
# Refer to ORACLE.txt for help.

# Importing the whole module instead of doing selective import seems to help find linker
# errors.
