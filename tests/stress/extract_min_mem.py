# Used to extract minimum memory data for test_mem_usage_scaling.py from stress test
# runtime info json.
#
# Usage
# =====
# Run the stress test binary search on the 3 node minicluster:
#
#   ./tests/stress/concurrent_select.py --tpch-db=tpch_parquet \
#       --runtime-info-path=mem_usage_scaling_runtime_info.json --samples 3 \
#       --mem_limit_eq_threshold_percent=0.01 --mem_limit_eq_threshold_mb=5 \
#       --common-query-options="default_spillable_buffer_size=256k"
#
# Then run this script to extract minimum memory:
#
#   ./tests/stress/extract_min_mem.py mem_usage_scaling_runtime_info.json
#

results = []
with open(sys.argv[1]) as f:
  data = json.load(f)
  for query_data in data['db_names']['tpch_parquet'].values():
    runtime_info = query_data['[]']
    # Build up list of query numbers and minimum memory.
    results.append((int(runtime_info['name'][1:]),
                   runtime_info['required_mem_mb_with_spilling']))

results.sort()
print(', '.join(["'Q{0}': {1}".format(num, mem) for num, mem in results]))
