  <!-- This pom creates a minimal version of the aws-java-sdk-bundle jar. The S3A
dependency is used here to ensure the correct version of the aws-java-sdk-bundle jar is
used. Only AWS service SDKs are excluded, all thirdparty jars are still included, even
though some of them might not be necessary. The exclusions are sorted alphabetically.
