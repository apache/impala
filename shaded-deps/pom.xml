  <!-- This pom creates a jar which excludes most of the hive-exec classes to
reduce the dependency footprint of hive in Impala. It uses maven-shade-plugin
to include only those classes which are needed by fe to compile and run in a
hive-3 environment. Additionally, it relocates some of the transitive dependencies
coming from hive-exec so that it does not conflict with Impala's version of
the same dependencies
